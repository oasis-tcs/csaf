# Conformance

In the only subsection of this section, the conformance targets and clauses are listed.
The clauses, matching the targets one to one, are listed in separate sub-subsections of the targets listing subsection.

Informative Comments:

> The order in which targets, and their corresponding clauses appear is somewhat arbitrary as there is
> no natural order on such diverse roles participating in the document exchanging ecosystem.
>
> Except for the target **CSAF document**, all other 22 targets span a taxonomy of the complex CSAF ecosystems existing
> in and between diverse security advisory generating, sharing, and consuming communities.
>
> In any case, there are no capabilities organized in increasing quality levels for targets because
> the security advisory sharing communities follow the chain link model.
> Instead, a single minimum capability level for every target is given to maintain important goals of providing
> a common framework for security advisories:
>
> * Fast production, sharing, and actionable consumption of security advisories
> * Consistent end to end automation through collaborating actors
> * Clear baseline across the communities per this specification
> * Additional per-community cooperative extensions which may flow back into future updates of this specification

### Conformance Clause 1: CSAF document

A text file or data stream satisfies the "CSAF document" conformance profile if it:

* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#date-and-time).
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#schema-elements).
* satisfies at least one profile defined in section [sec](#profiles).
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#additional-conventions).
* does not fail any mandatory test defined in section [sec](#mandatory-tests).

### Conformance Clause 2: CSAF producer

A program satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile if the program:

* produces output in the CSAF format, according to the conformance profile "CSAF document".
* satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) and [sec](#safety-security-and-data-protection-considerations) that
  are designated as applying to CSAF producers.

### Conformance Clause 3: CSAF direct producer

An analysis tool satisfies the "CSAF direct producer" conformance profile if the analysis tool:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to "direct producers" or
  to "analysis tools".
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [sec](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by converters.

### Conformance Clause 4: CSAF converter

A converter satisfies the “CSAF converter” conformance profile if the converter:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to converters.
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [sec](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by direct producers.

### Conformance Clause 5: CVRF CSAF converter

A program satisfies the "CVRF CSAF converter" conformance profile if the program fulfills the following two groups of requirements:

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CVRF documents as input.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* type `/$defs/branches_t`: If any `prod:Branch` instance has the type `Realm` or `Resource`,
  the CVRF CSAF converter replaces those with the category `product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that those types do not exist in CSAF and have been replaced with the category `product_name`.
* type `/$defs/version_t`: If any element doesn't match the semantic versioning,
  replace the all elements of type `/$defs/version_t` with the corresponding integer version.
  For that, CVRF CSAF converter sorts the items of `/document/tracking/revision_history` by `number` ascending according to the rules of CVRF.
  Then, it replaces the value of `number` with the index number in the array (starting with 1).
  The value of `/document/tracking/version` is replaced by value of `number` of the corresponding revision item.
  The match MUST be calculated by the original values used in the CVRF document.
  If this conversion was applied, for each Revision the original value of `cvrf:Number` MUST be set as `legacy_version` in the converted document.
* `/document/acknowledgments[]/organization` and `/vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments[]/organization`:
  If more than one `cvrf:Organization` instance is given, the CVRF CSAF converter converts the first one into the `organization`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of document or vulnerability acknowledgment.
* `/document/lang`: If one or more CVRF element containing an `xml:lang` attribute exist and contain the exact same value,
  the CVRF CSAF converter converts this value into `lang`.
  If the values of `xml:lang` attributes are not equal, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that the language could not be
  determined and possibly a document with multiple languages was produced.
  In addition, it SHOULD also present all values of `xml:lang` attributes as a set in the warning.
* `/document/publisher/name` and `/document/publisher/namespace`:
  Sets the value as given in the configuration of the program or the corresponding argument the program was invoked with.
  If values from both sources are present, the program SHOULD prefer the latter one.
  The program SHALL NOT use hard-coded values.
* `/document/tracking/id`: If the element `cvrf:ID` contains any line breaks or leading or trailing white space,
  the CVRF CSAF converter removes those characters.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that the ID was changed.
* `/product_tree/relationships[]`: If more than one `prod:FullProductName` instance is given,
  the CVRF CSAF converter converts the first one into the `full_product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of product relationships.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`:
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
    using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of
    `/document/tracking/current_release_date` of the source document.
    If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
    of the source document SHOULD be used.
    > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

    If the CWE does not match at all, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST omit this CWE and output a warning that an invalid CWE was found and has
    been removed.
  * If a `vuln:CWE` instance refers to a CWE category or view, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST omit this instance and output a
    warning that this CWE has been removed as its usage is not allowed in vulnerability mappings.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/ids`: If a `vuln:ID` element is given, the CVRF CSAF converter converts it into the first item of the `ids` array.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * If neither `product_ids` nor `group_ids` are given, the CVRF CSAF converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under
    `../product_status` in the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected` into `product_ids`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this remediation element.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `Vendor Fix` into the category `optional_patch` if the product in
    question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST be set.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to
    different product status groups, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance
    to `optional_patch` and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `None Available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the future or no `Date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the type `None Available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]`:
  * For any CVSS v4 element, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard. (CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v4.0.)
  * For any CVSS v3 element, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard.
  * If no `product_id` is given, the CVRF CSAF converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under `../product_status` in
    the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this score element.
  * If a `vectorString` is missing, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that the CVSS element could not be converted as
    the CVSS vector was missing.
    A CVRF CSAF converter MAY offer a configuration option to delete such elements.
  * If there are CVSS v3.0 and CVSS v3.1 Vectors available for the same product, the CVRF CSAF converter discards
    the CVSS v3.0 information and provide in CSAF only the CVSS v3.1 information.
  * To determine, which minor version of CVSS v3 is used and to evaluate a CVSS v4 that was wrongly inserted in a CVSS v3 element,
    the CVRF CSAF converter uses the following steps:
    1. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS vector, if present.

        *Example 1:*

        ```
          CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H => 3.1
        ```

    2. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS element's namespace, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the element's namespace.

        *Example 2:*

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv31="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd"
          <!-- -->
          <cvssv31:ScoreSetV3>
        ```

        is handled the same as

        *Example 3:*

        ```
          <ScoreSetV3 xmlns="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd">
        ```

    3. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS namespace given in the root element, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the global namespace.
       If more than one CVSS namespace is present and the element is not clearly defined via the namespace,
       this step MUST be skipped without a decision.

        *Example 4:*

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv3="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.xsd" => 3.0
        ```

    4. Retrieve the CVSS version from a config value, which defaults to `3.0`.
       (As CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v3.1.) The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was taken from the config.

### Conformance Clause 6: CSAF content management system

A CSAF content management system satisfies the "CSAF content management system" conformance profile if the content management system:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.

    (see also subsections of [sec](#version-type)).
  * suggest to use the document status `interim` if a CSAF document is updated more frequent than the given threshold in
    the configuration (default: 3 weeks)
  * suggest to publish a new version of the CSAF document with the document status `final` if the document status was
    `interim` and no new release has be done during the given threshold in the configuration (default: 6 weeks)

    * when a new asset is inserted (for this asset)
    * when the Major version in a CSAF document with semantic versioning changes (for this CSAF document)
    > These also apply if more than one CSAF document or asset was added.
    > To reduce the computational efforts the runs can be pooled into one run which fulfills all the tasks at once (batch mode).
  * Manually and automatically triggered runs SHOULD NOT be pooled.
* provides at least the following statistics for the count of assets:

  This might be done with a probability which gives the user the chance to broaden or narrow the results.
  The process of matching is also referred to as "run of the SBOM matching module".
* provides for each SBOM of the SBOM database a list of matched advisories.
* provides for each SBOM component of the SBOM database a list of matched advisories.
* provides for each CSAF document a list of matched SBOMs of the SBOM database.
* provides for each CSAF document a list of matched SBOM components of the SBOM database.
* provides for each vulnerability within a CSAF document the option to mark a matched SBOM component in the SBOM database as "not remediated",
  "remediation in progress", or "remediation done".
  A switch to mark all SBOM component at once MAY be implemented.
* does not bring up a newer revision of a CSAF document as a new match if the remediation for the matched SBOM or SBOM component has not changed.
* detects the usage semantic version (as described in section [sec](#version-type-semantic-versioning)).
* is able to trigger a run of the SBOM matching module:
  * manually:
    * per CSAF document
    * per list of CSAF documents
    * per SBOM component
    * per list of SBOM components
  * automatically:
    * when a new CSAF document is inserted (for this CSAF document)
    * when a new SBOM component is inserted (for this SBOM component)
    * when the Major version in a CSAF document with semantic versioning changes (for this CSAF document)
    > These also apply if more than one CSAF document or SBOM component was added.
    > To reduce the computational efforts the runs can be pooled into one run which fulfills all the tasks at once (batch mode).
  > Manually and automatically triggered runs should not be pooled.
* provides at least the following statistics for the count of SBOM component:
  * matching that CSAF document at all
  * marked with a given status

### Conformance Clause 18: CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter

A program satisfies the "CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter" conformance profile if the program fulfills the following two groups of requirements:

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CSAF 2.0 documents as input.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/cpe`: If a CPE is invalid, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD removed the
  invalid value and output a warning that an invalid CPE was detected and removed. Such a warning MUST include the invalid CPE.
* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/purls`: If a `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/purl` is given,
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert it into the first item of the corresponding `purls` array.
* `/$schema`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST set property with the value prescribed by the schema.
* `/document/csaf_version`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST update the value to `2.1`.
* `/document/distribution/tlp/label`: If a TLP label is given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert it according to the table below:
  
  | CSAF 2.0 (using TLP v1.0) | CSAF 2.1 (using TLP v2.0) |
  |---------------------------|---------------------------|
  | `TLP:WHITE`               | `TLP:CLEAR`               |
  | `TLP:GREEN`               | `TLP:GREEN`               |
  | `TLP:AMBER`               | `TLP:AMBER`               |
  | `TLP:RED`                 | `TLP:RED`                 |

  If `/document/distribution/text` contains the string `TLP v2.0: TLP:<ValidTLPLabel>`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD provide an
  option to use this label instead. If the TLP label changes through such conversion in a way that is not reflected in the table above, the
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST output a warning that the TLP label was taken from the distribution text. Such a warning MUST include
  both values: the converted one based on the table and the one from the distribution text.
  > This is a common case for CSAF 2.0 documents labeled as `TLP:RED` but actually intended to be `TLP:AMBER+STRICT`.

  If no TLP label was given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD assign `TLP:CLEAR` and output a warning that the default TLP has been set.
* `/document/publisher/category`: If the value is `other`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD output a warning that some parties have
  been regrouped into the new value `multiplier`. An option to suppress this warning MUST exist. In addition, an option SHOULD be provided to
  set the value to `multiplier`.
* `/document/title`: If the value contains the `/document/tracking/id`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST remove the `/document/tracking/id`
  from the `/document/title`. In addition, separating characters including but not limited to whitespace, colon, dash and brackets MUST be removed.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
  using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
  of the source document. If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
  of the source document SHOULD be used.
  > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

  The tool SHOULD implement an option to use the latest available CWE version at the time of the conversion that still matches.

* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `vendor_fix` into the category `optional_patch`
    if the product in question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST stay the same.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to different
    product status groups, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance to `optional_patch`
    and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `none_available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the future or no `date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the category `none_available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.

> A tool MAY implement options to convert other Markdown formats to GitHub-flavored Markdown.

> A tool MAY implement an additional, non-default option to output an invalid document that can be fixed afterwards. Solely in this case, any
> of the rules above MAY be ignored to avoid data loss.
