# Conformance

In the only subsection of this section, the conformance targets and clauses are listed.
The clauses, matching the targets one to one, are listed in separate sub-subsections of the targets listing subsection.

Informative Comments:

> The order in which targets, and their corresponding clauses appear is somewhat arbitrary as there is
> no natural order on such diverse roles participating in the document exchanging ecosystem.
>
> Except for the target **CSAF Document**, all other 24 targets span a taxonomy of the complex CSAF ecosystems existing
> in and between diverse security advisory generating, sharing, and consuming communities.
>
> In any case, there are no capabilities organized in increasing quality levels for targets because
> the security advisory sharing communities follow the chain link model.
> Instead, a single minimum capability level for every target is given to maintain important goals of providing
> a common framework for security advisories:
>
> * Fast production, sharing, and actionable consumption of security advisories
> * Consistent end to end automation through collaborating actors
> * Clear baseline across the communities per this specification
> * Additional per-community cooperative extensions which may flow back into future updates of this specification

### Conformance Clause 1: CSAF Document

A text file or data stream satisfies the "CSAF Document" conformance profile if it:

* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#format-validation).
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#date-and-time).
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#schema-elements).
* satisfies at least one profile defined in section [sec](#profiles).
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [sec](#additional-conventions).
* does not fail any mandatory test defined in section [sec](#mandatory-tests).

### Conformance Clause 2: CSAF Producer

A program satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile if the program:

* produces output in the CSAF format, according to the conformance profile "CSAF Document".
* satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) and [sec](#safety-security-and-data-protection-considerations) that
  are designated as applying to CSAF Producers.

### Conformance Clause 3: CSAF Direct Producer

An analysis tool satisfies the "CSAF Direct Producer" conformance profile if the analysis tool:

* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to "direct producers" or
  to "analysis tools".
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [sec](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by converters.

### Conformance Clause 4: CSAF Converter

A converter satisfies the “CSAF Converter” conformance profile if the converter:

* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to converters.
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [sec](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by direct producers.

### Conformance Clause 5: CVRF CSAF Converter

A program satisfies the "CVRF CSAF Converter" conformance profile if the program fulfills the following two groups of requirements:

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CVRF documents as input.
* outputs a warning that an additional property was detected and not converted if it detects an additional property in the input.
  The CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL ignore that additional property during the conversion.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* value type `string` with format `date-time`: If the value contains a `60` in the seconds place, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST replace the seconds
  and their fractions with `59.999999`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that leap seconds are now prohibited in CSAF and the value has been replaced.
  The CVRF CSAF Converter SHOULD indicate in such warning message whether the value was a valid leap second or not.
* type `/$defs/branches_t`: If any `prod:Branch` instance has the type `Realm` or `Resource`,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter replaces those with the category `product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that those types do not exist in CSAF and have been replaced with the category `product_name`.
* type `/$defs/version_t`: If any element doesn't match the semantic versioning,
  replace the all elements of type `/$defs/version_t` with the corresponding integer version.
  For that, CVRF CSAF Converter sorts the items of `/document/tracking/revision_history` by `number` ascending according to the rules of CVRF.
  Then, it replaces the value of `number` with the index number in the array (starting with 1).
  The value of `/document/tracking/version` is replaced by value of `number` of the corresponding revision item.
  The match MUST be calculated by the original values used in the CVRF document.
  If this conversion was applied, for each Revision the original value of `cvrf:Number` MUST be set as `legacy_version` in the converted document.
* `/document/acknowledgments[]/organization` and `/vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments[]/organization`:
  If more than one `cvrf:Organization` instance is given, the CVRF CSAF Converter converts the first one into the `organization`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of document or vulnerability acknowledgment.
* `/document/category`:
  * If the `cvrf:DocumentType` is Security Advisory (case-insensitive), the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST try to convert the data
    into a valid CSAF Document in this profile according to CSAF 2.1.

    > A tool MAY offer rules to create the missing fixed products from version ranges, if applicable.

    If the CVRF CSAF Converter is unable to create a valid CSAF 2.1 Document according to the profile, it SHALL set the `category` value to
    `csaf_deprecated_security_advisory`.
  * If one or more CVRF elements containing an `xml:lang` attribute exist and their value is English or
    the document language of the CVRF document is unspecified,
    the following rules apply:
    * If the `cvrf:DocumentTitle` starts with the string `Superseded` or the `cvrf:DocumentType` starts with `Superseded` (case-insensitive),
      the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST try to convert all data into a valid CSAF Document in the profile "Superseded" according to CSAF 2.1.
    * If the `cvrf:DocumentTitle` starts with the string `Withdrawn` or the `cvrf:DocumentType` starts with `Withdrawn` (case-insensitive),
      the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST try to convert all data into a valid CSAF Document in the profile "Withdrawn" according to CSAF 2.1.

    > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to remove or transform certain or all elements the hinder the creation of a valid CSAF Document according
    > to the profile.

    > A tool MAY support this detection for other languages.

    If the CVRF CSAF Converter is unable to create a valid CSAF 2.1 Document according to the profile, it SHALL set the `category`
    according to the conversion rules and output a warning a potentially withdrawn CSAF Document was created which would result in an invalid CSAF.
* `/document/lang`: If one or more CVRF elements containing an `xml:lang` attribute exist and contain the exact same value,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter converts this value into `lang`.
  If the values of `xml:lang` attributes are not equal, the CVRF CSAF Converter outputs a warning that the language could not be
  determined and possibly a document with multiple languages was produced.
  In addition, it SHOULD also present all values of `xml:lang` attributes as a set in the warning.
* `/document/license_expression`: If any `cvrf:Note` item with `Type` `Legal Disclaimer` contains a valid SPDX license expression,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL convert this value into `license_expression`.
  In addition, the converter outputs an information that license expression was found and set as document license expression.
* `/document/notes`: If any `cvrf:Note` item contains one of the `category` and `title` combinations specified in [sec](#document-property-notes),
  where the `title` is extended, the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL try to identify whether that extension is a specific product name, version or family.
  In such case, the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL try to add the corresponding products to the note item and output a warning that a potential product
  specific note has been discovered and products have been assigned to it.
  Such warning MUST also include the note and the assigned products.
  If the CVRF CSAF Converter is unable to create a valid object, it MUST remove the reference to the products and output a warning that a potential
  product specific note has been discovered and no products could been assigned to it.
* `/document/publisher/name` and `/document/publisher/namespace`:
  Sets the value as given in the configuration of the program or the corresponding argument the program was invoked with.
  If values from both sources are present, the program SHOULD prefer the latter one.
  The program SHALL NOT use hard-coded values.
* `/document/tracking/id`: If the element `cvrf:ID` contains any newline sequence or leading or trailing white space,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter removes those characters.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that the ID was changed.
* `/product_tree/relationships[]`: If more than one `prod:FullProductName` instance is given,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter converts the first one into the `full_product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of product relationships.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`:
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST remove all preceding and trailing white space from the `name`.
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
    using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of
    `/document/tracking/current_release_date` of the source document.
    If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
    of the source document SHOULD be used.

    > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

    If the CWE does not match at all, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST omit this CWE and output a warning that an invalid CWE was found and has
    been removed.
  * If a `vuln:CWE` instance refers to a CWE category or view, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST omit this instance and output a
    warning that this CWE has been removed as its usage is not allowed in vulnerability mappings.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/disclosure_date`: If a `vuln:ReleaseDate` was given, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST convert its value into the `disclosure_date` element.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/ids`: If a `vuln:ID` element is given, the CVRF CSAF Converter converts it into the first item of the `ids` array.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]`:
  * For any CVSS v4 element, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard. (CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v4.0.)
  * For any CVSS v3 element, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard.
  * If no `product_id` is given, the CVRF CSAF Converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under `../product_status` in
    the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF Converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this score element.
  * If a `vectorString` is missing, the CVRF CSAF Converter outputs an error that the CVSS element could not be converted as
    the CVSS vector was missing.
    A CVRF CSAF Converter MAY offer a configuration option to delete such elements.
  * If there are CVSS v3.0 and CVSS v3.1 Vectors available for the same product, the CVRF CSAF Converter discards
    the CVSS v3.0 information and provide in CSAF only the CVSS v3.1 information.
  * To determine, which minor version of CVSS v3 is used and to evaluate a CVSS v4 that was wrongly inserted in a CVSS v3 element,
    the CVRF CSAF Converter uses the following steps:
    1. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS vector, if present.

        *Example 1:*

        ```
          CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H => 3.1
        ```

    2. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS element's namespace, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF Converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the element's namespace.

        *Example 2:*

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv31="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd"
          <!-- -->
          <cvssv31:ScoreSetV3>
        ```

        is handled the same as

        *Example 3:*

        ```
          <ScoreSetV3 xmlns="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd">
        ```

    3. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS namespace given in the root element, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF Converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the global namespace.
       If more than one CVSS namespace is present and the element is not clearly defined via the namespace,
       this step MUST be skipped without a decision.

        *Example 4:*

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv3="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.xsd" => 3.0
        ```

    4. Retrieve the CVSS version from a config value, which defaults to `3.0`.
       (As CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v3.1.) The CVRF CSAF Converter outputs a warning that this value was taken from the config.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics/cvss_v4`: If an external reference in the vulnerability linking to the official FIRST.org CVSS v4.0 calculator exists,
  the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST convert the vector given in the fragment into a `cvss_v4` object linked to all affected products of the vulnerability.

  > A tool MAY implement an option to suppress this conversion.

  If the CVRF CSAF Converter is unable to construct a valid object with the information given, the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL
  remove the invalid `cvss_v4` object and output a warning that the automatic conversion of the CVSS v4.0 reference failed.
  Such warning SHOULD include the specific error that occurred.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/notes`: If any `vuln:Note` item contains one of the `category` and `title` combinations specified in
  [sec](#vulnerabilities-property-notes), where the `title` is extended, the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL try to identify whether that extension is
  a specific product name, version or family.
  In such case, the CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL try to add the corresponding products to the note item and output a warning that a potential product
  specific note has been discovered and products have been assigned to it.
  Such warning MUST also include the note and the assigned products.
  If the CVRF CSAF Converter is unable to create a valid object, it MUST remove the reference to the products and output a warning that a potential
  product specific note has been discovered and no products could been assigned to it.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * If neither `product_ids` nor `group_ids` are given, the CVRF CSAF Converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under
    `../product_status` in the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected` into `product_ids`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF Converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this remediation element.
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `Vendor Fix` into the category `optional_patch` if the product in
    question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST be set.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to
    different product status groups, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance
    to `optional_patch` and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `None Available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the future or no `Date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the type `None Available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CVRF CSAF Converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CVRF CSAF Converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.
* The CVRF CSAF Converter SHALL provide the JSON path where the warning occurred together with the warning.

### Conformance Clause 6: CSAF Content Management System

A CSAF Content Management System satisfies the "CSAF Content Management System" conformance profile if the content management system:

* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.

    (see also subsections of [sec](#version-type)).
  * suggest to use the document status `interim` if a CSAF Document is updated more frequent than the given threshold in
    the configuration (default: `3` weeks)
  * suggest to publish a new version of the CSAF Document with the document status `final` if the document status was
    `interim` and no new release has be done during the given threshold in the configuration (default: `6` weeks)

    > Note that the terms "publish", "publication" and their derived forms are used in this conformance profile independent of
      whether the specified target group is the public or a closed group.

  * support the following workflows:

    * "New Advisory": create a new advisory, request a review, provide review comments or approve it, resolve review comments;
      if the review approved it, the approval for publication can be requested;

  * _Administrator_: inherits _Manager_ permissions and can Change the configuration

* may use groups to support client separation (multitenancy) and therefore restrict the roles to actions within their group.
  In this case, there MUST be a _Group configurator_ which is able to change the values which are used to prefill fields in
  new advisories for that group. He might also do the user management for the group up to a configured level.

* satisfies the "CSAF Consumer" conformance profile.
* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [sec](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to post-processors.

### Conformance Clause 8: CSAF Modifier

A program satisfies the "CSAF Modifier" conformance profile if the program fulfills the two following groups of requirements:

The program:

* satisfies the "CSAF Post-Processor" conformance profile.
* adds, deletes or modifies at least one property, array, object or value of a property or item of an array.
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [sec](#conformance),
  are intended to be produced only by CSAF Translators.
* satisfies the normative requirements given below.

The resulting modified document:

* does not have the same `/document/tracking/id` as the original document.
  The modified document can use a completely new `/document/tracking/id` or compute one by appending the original `/document/tracking/id` as
  a suffix after an ID from the naming scheme of the issuer of the modified version.
  It SHOULD NOT use the original `/document/tracking/id` as a prefix.
* includes a reference to the original advisory as first element of the array `/document/references[]`.

### Conformance Clause 9: CSAF Translator

A program satisfies the "CSAF Translator" conformance profile if the program fulfills the two following groups of requirements:

The program:

* satisfies the "CSAF Post-Processor" conformance profile.
* translates at least one value.
* preserves the same semantics and form across translations.
* satisfies the normative requirements given below and does not add or remove other elements than required below.

The resulting translated document:

* does not use the same `/document/tracking/id` as the original document.
  The translated document can use a completely new `/document/tracking/id` or compute one by using the original `/document/tracking/id` as
  a prefix and adding an ID from the naming scheme of the issuer of the translated version.
  It SHOULD NOT use the original `/document/tracking/id` as a suffix.
  If an issuer uses a CSAF Translator to publish his advisories in multiple languages they MAY use the combination of
  the original `/document/tracking/id` and translated `/document/lang` as a `/document/tracking/id` for the translated document.

  > Note that the term "publish" is used in this conformance profile independent of whether the specified target group is the public
    or a closed group.

* provides the `/document/lang` property with a value matching the language of the translation.
* provides the `/document/source_lang` to contain the language of the original document (and SHOULD only be set by CSAF Translators).
* has the value `translator` set in `/document/publisher/category`
* includes a reference to the original advisory as first element of the array `/document/references[]`.
* MAY contain translations for elements in arrays of `references_t` after the first element.
  However, it MUST keep the original URLs as references at the end.

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF Producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CSAF 2.0 Documents as input.
* outputs a warning that an additional property was detected and not converted if it detects an additional property in the input.
  The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL ignore that additional property during the conversion.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* value type `string` with format `date-time`: If the value contains a `60` in the seconds place, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST replace
  the seconds and their fractions with `59.999999`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that leap seconds are now prohibited in CSAF and the value has been replaced.
  The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD indicate in such warning message whether the value was a valid leap second or not.
* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/cpe`: If a CPE is invalid, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD removed the
  invalid value and output a warning that an invalid CPE was detected and removed. Such a warning MUST include the invalid CPE.
* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/model_number`:
  * If a model number is given that does not end on a star, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD add a `*` to the end and output a
    warning that a partial model number was detected and a star has been added.
    Such a warning MUST include the model number.
  * If the model number contains a `\`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST escape it by inserting an additional `\` before the character.
  * If the model number contains multiple unescaped `*` after the conversion, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST remove the entry and
    output a warning that a model number with multiple stars was detected and removed.
    Such a warning MUST include the model number.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret all model numbers as complete and therefore does not add any stars.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret the `?` in all model numbers as part of the model number itself and therefore escape it.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret the `*` in all model numbers as part of the model number itself and therefore escape it.

* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/purls`: If a `/$defs/full_product_name_t/product_identification_helper/purl` is given,
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert it into the first item of the corresponding `purls` array.
* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/serial_number`:
  * If a serial number is given that does not end on a star, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD add a `*` to the end and output a
    warning that a partial serial number was detected and a star has been added.
    Such a warning MUST include the serial number.
  * If the serial number contains a `\`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST escape it by inserting an additional `\` before the character.
  * If the serial number contains multiple unescaped `*` after the conversion, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST remove the entry and
    output a warning that a serial number with multiple stars was detected and removed.
    Such a warning MUST include the serial number.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret all serial numbers as complete and therefore does not add any stars.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret the `?` in all serial numbers as part of the serial number itself and therefore escape it.

  > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to interpret the `*` in all serial numbers as part of the serial number itself and therefore escape it.

* `/$schema`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST set property with the value prescribed by the schema.
* `/document/category`:
  * If the `category` equals `csaf_security_advisory`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST try to convert the data into a
    valid CSAF Document in this profile according to CSAF 2.1.
    For any version range of affected products that uses the strict `<`, i.e. not `<=`, as comparator of the last version constraint, the CSAF 2.0
    to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD add a new product with the version of the last constraint and add that in the appropriate places as `fixed`.
    The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST output a warning that a product was added to the `product_tree` and the corresponding `/vulnerabilities[]`.
    Such warning MUST contain the full product name and its path as well as the paths of the `/vulnerabilities[]` it was added to.
    If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to create a valid CSAF 2.1 Document according to the profile, it SHALL set the `category` value to
    `csaf_deprecated_security_advisory`.
  * If the `/document/lang` is English or unspecified, the following rules apply:
    * If the `/document/title` starts with the string `Superseded` or the `/document/category` has the value `Superseded` (case-insensitive),
      the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST try to convert all data into a valid CSAF Document in the profile "Superseded" according to CSAF 2.1.
    * If the `/document/title` starts with the string `Withdrawn` or the `/document/category` has the value `Withdrawn` (case-insensitive),
      the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST try to convert all data into a valid CSAF Document in the profile "Withdrawn" according to CSAF 2.1.
 
    > A tool MAY provide a non-default option to remove or transform certain or all elements the hinder the creation of a valid CSAF Document according
    > to the profile.

    > A tool MAY support this detection for other languages.

    If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to create a valid CSAF 2.1 Document according to the profile, it SHALL set the `category`
    of the original CSAF Document and output a warning a potentially withdrawn CSAF Document was created which would result in an invalid CSAF.
* `/document/csaf_version`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST update the value to `2.1`.
* `/document/distribution/tlp/label`: If a TLP label is given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert it according to the table below:
  
  | CSAF 2.0 (using TLP v1.0) | CSAF 2.1 (using TLP v2.0) |
  |---------------------------|---------------------------|
  | `TLP:WHITE`               | `TLP:CLEAR`               |
  | `TLP:GREEN`               | `TLP:GREEN`               |
  | `TLP:AMBER`               | `TLP:AMBER`               |
  | `TLP:RED`                 | `TLP:RED`                 |

  If `/document/distribution/text` contains the string `TLP v2.0: TLP:<ValidTLPLabel>`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD provide an
  option to use this label instead. If the TLP label changes through such conversion in a way that is not reflected in the table above, the
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST output a warning that the TLP label was taken from the distribution text. Such a warning MUST include
  both values: the converted one based on the table and the one from the distribution text.

  > This is a common case for CSAF 2.0 Documents labeled as `TLP:RED` but actually intended to be `TLP:AMBER+STRICT`.

  If no TLP label was given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD assign `TLP:CLEAR` and output a warning that the default TLP has been set.
  * `/document/license_expression`: If any `/document/notes` item in with `category` `legal_disclaimer` contains a valid SPDX license expression,
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL convert this value into `license_expression`.
  In addition, the converter outputs an information that license expression was found and set as document license expression.
* `/document/notes`: If any `/document/notes` item contains one of the `category` and `title` combinations specified in
  [sec](#document-property-notes), where the `title` is extended, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL try to identify whether that extension
  is a specific product name, version or family.
  In such case, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Coverter SHALL try to add the corresponding products to the note item and output a warning that a potential product
  specific note has been discovered and products have been assigned to it.
  Such warning MUST also include the note and the assigned products.
  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to create a valid object, it MUST remove the reference to the products and output a warning that a potential
  product specific note has been discovered and no products could been assigned to it.
* `/document/publisher/category`: If the value is `other`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHOULD output a warning that some parties have
  been regrouped into the new value `multiplier`. An option to suppress this warning MUST exist. In addition, an option SHOULD be provided to
  set the value to `multiplier`.
* `/document/title`: If the value contains the `/document/tracking/id`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST remove the `/document/tracking/id`
  from the `/document/title`. In addition, separating characters including but not limited to whitespace, colon, dash and brackets MUST be removed.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`:
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST remove all preceding and trailing white space from the `name`.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
    using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of
    `/document/tracking/current_release_date` of the source document.
    If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
    of the source document SHOULD be used.

    > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

    The tool SHOULD implement an option to use the latest available CWE version at the time of the conversion that still matches.

* `/vulnerabilities[]/disclosure_date`: If a `release_date` was given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert its value as value 
  into the `disclosure_date` element.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics/cvss_v4`: If an external reference in the vulnerability linking to the official FIRST.org CVSS v4.0 calculator exists,
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert the vector given in the fragment into a `cvss_v4` object linked to all affected products of the vulnerability.
  
  > A tool MAY implement an option to suppress this conversion.

  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to construct a valid object with the information given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL
  remove the invalid `cvss_v4` object and output a warning that the automatic conversion of the CVSS v4.0 reference failed.
  Such warning SHOULD include the specific error that occurred.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics/ssvc_v1`: If a SSVC vector or decision points of an SSVC vector are given in an item of `notes` of the current
  vulnerability using the `title` `SSVC` and the `category` `other`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert that data into the `ssvc_v1`
  object within the current vulnerability.
  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is able to construct a valid object without loosing any information, the corresponding `notes` item SHALL
  be removed.
  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to construct a valid object with the information given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL
  remove the invalid `ssvc_v1` object, keep the original item of `notes` and output a warning that the automatic conversion of the SSVC data failed.
  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter would loose information during the conversion, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL remove the `ssvc_v1`
  object, keep the original item of `notes` and output a warning that the automatic conversion of the SSVC data would lead to loosing information.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/notes`: If any `/vulnerabilities[]/notes` item contains one of the `category` and `title` combinations specified in
  [sec](#vulnerabilities-property-notes), where the `title` is extended, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL try to identify whether that
  extension is a specific product name, version or family.
  In such case, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL try to add the corresponding products to the note item and output a warning that a potential
  product specific note has been discovered and products have been assigned to it.
  Such warning MUST also include the note and the assigned products.
  If the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter is unable to create a valid object, it MUST remove the reference to the products and output a warning that a
  potential product specific note has been discovered and no products could been assigned to it.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `vendor_fix` into the category `optional_patch`
    if the product in question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST stay the same.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to different
    product status groups, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance to `optional_patch`
    and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `none_available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the future or no `date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the category `none_available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.
* The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 Converter SHALL provide the JSON path where the warning occurred together with the warning.

> A tool MAY implement options to convert other Markdown formats to GitHub-flavored Markdown.

> A tool MAY implement an additional, non-default option to output an invalid document that can be fixed afterwards. Solely in this case, any
> of the rules above MAY be ignored to avoid data loss.
