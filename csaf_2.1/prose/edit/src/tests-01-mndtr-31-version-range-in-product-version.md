### Version Range in Product Version

For each element of type `/$defs/branches_t` with `category` of `product_version` it MUST be tested that
the value of `name` does not contain a version range.

> To implement this test it is deemed sufficient that, when converted to lower case, the value of `name` satisfies the two requirements below:
>
> 1. It does not contain any of the following operators:
>
>    ```
>      <
>      <=
>      >
>      >=
>    ```
>
> 2. If interpreted as a list of individual words separated by whitespace, the list does not contain any of the following keywords:
>
>    ```
>      after
>      all
>      before
>      earlier
>      later
>      prior
>      versions
>    ```

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/name
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
            "branches": [
              {
                "category": "product_version",
                "name": "prior to 4.2",
                // ...
              }
            ]
```

> The version range `prior to 4.2` is given for the branch category `product_version`.
