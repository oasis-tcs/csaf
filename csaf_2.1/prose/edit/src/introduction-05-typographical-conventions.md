## Typographical Conventions

Keywords defined by this specification use `this monospaced font` to help distinguish these from common english words.

```
    Normative source code uses this paragraph style.
```

Some sections of this specification are illustrated with non-normative examples introduced with "Example" or "Examples" like so:

*Example 1:*

```
    Informative examples also use this paragraph style, ←
    but preceded by the text "Example(s)".
```

The left pointing arrow character (`←`) at the end of the first line in the preceding example is inserted only to
enable the display of code and examples within paged formats.
Presence of this character indicates that the content of the following line is to be appended by
(a) replacing that character, and (b) removing any amount of common left space indent of these lines.

All examples in this document are informative only.

All other text is normative unless otherwise labeled e.g. like the following informative comment:

> This is a pure informative comment that may be present, because the information conveyed is deemed useful advice or
> common pitfalls learned from implementer or operator experience and often given including the rationale.
