the file which is identified by the hash values.

*Examples 3:*

```
    WINWORD.EXE
    msotadddin.dll
    sudoers.so
```

If the value of the hash matches and the filename does not, a user SHOULD prefer the hash value.
In such cases, the filename SHOULD be used as informational property.

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - Model Numbers

The list of models (`model_numbers`) of value type `array` with 1 or more unique items contains a list of full or
abbreviated (partial) model numbers.

A list of models SHOULD only be used if a certain range of model numbers with its corresponding software version is affected,
or the model numbers change during update.

This can also be used to identify hardware.
If necessary, the software, or any other related part, SHALL be bind to that via a product relationship.

```
    "model_numbers": {
        //...
      "items": {
        //...
      }
    },
```

Any given model number of value type `string` with at least 1 character represents a full or abbreviated (partial) model number of
the component to identify.

> The terms "model", "model number" and "model variant" are mostly used synonymously.
> Often it is abbreviated as "MN", M/N" or "model no.".

If a part of a model number of the component to identify is given,
it SHOULD begin with the first character of the model number and stop at any point.
Characters which SHOULD NOT be matched MUST be replaced by either `?` (for a single character) or `*` (for zero or more characters).  
Two `*` MUST NOT follow each other.

*Examples 1:*

```
    6RA8096-4MV62-0AA0
    6RA801?-??V62-0AA0
    IC25T060ATCS05-0
```

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - purls

List of purls (`purls`) of value type `array` with 1 or more items contains a list of package URL (purl) identifiers.
A purl is a `string` of 7 or more characters that meets the criteria of `pattern` (regular expression):

```
    ^pkg:[A-Za-z\\.\\-\\+][A-Za-z0-9\\.\\-\\+]*\\/.+
```

> The given pattern does not completely evaluate whether a purl is valid according to the [cite](#PURL) specification.
> It provides a more generic approach and general guidance to enable forward compatibility.
> CSAF uses only the canonical form of purl to conform with section 3.3 of [cite](#RFC3986).
> Therefore, URLs starting with `pkg://` are considered invalid.

A package URL (purl) attribute refers to a method for reliably identifying and locating software packages external to this specification.
See [cite](#PURL) for details. Multiple purls can be specified to allow for identifiers to locate identical components in different locations.

If multiple purls are specified, they SHALL only differ in their qualifiers. Otherwise, separate product branches
should be used to differentiate between the components.

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - SBOM URLs

The list of SBOM URLs (`sbom_urls`) of value type `array` with 1 or more items contains
a list of URLs where SBOMs for this product can be retrieved.

```
    "sbom_urls": {
        //...
      "items": {
        //...
      }
    },
```

Any given SBOM URL of value type `string` with format `uri` contains a URL of one SBOM for this product.

*Examples 1:*

```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/bom-examples/master/SBOM/keycloak-10.0.2/bom.json
    https://swinslow.net/spdx-examples/example4/main-bin-v2
```

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - Serial Numbers

The list of serial numbers (`serial_numbers`) of value type `array` with 1 or more unique items contains
a list of full or abbreviated (partial) serial numbers.

A list of serial numbers SHOULD only be used if a certain range of serial numbers with its corresponding software version is affected,
or the serial numbers change during update.

```
    "serial_numbers": {
        //...
      "items": {
        //...
      }
    },
```

Any given serial number of value type `string` with at least 1 character represents a full or
abbreviated (partial) serial number of the component to identify.

If a part of a serial number of the component to identify is given,
it SHOULD begin with the first character of the serial number and stop at any point.
Characters which SHOULD NOT be matched MUST be replaced by either `?` (for a single character) or `*` (for zero or more characters).  
Two `*` MUST NOT follow each other.

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - SKUs

The list of stock keeping units (`skus`) of value type `array` with 1 or more items contains a list of full or
abbreviated (partial) stock keeping units.

A list of stock keeping units SHOULD only be used if the list of relationships is used to decouple e.g. hardware from the software,
or the stock keeping units change during update.
In the latter case the remediations SHALL include the new stock keeping units or a description how it can be obtained.

> The use of the list of relationships in the first case is important.
> Otherwise, the end user is unable to identify which version (the affected or the not affected / fixed one) is used.

```
    "skus": {
        //...  
      "items": {
        //...  
      }
    },
```

Any given stock keeping unit of value type `string` with at least 1 character represents a full or
abbreviated (partial) stock keeping unit (SKU) of the component to identify.

> Sometimes this is also called "item number", "article number" or "product number".

If a part of a stock keeping unit of the component to identify is given, it SHOULD begin with the first character of
the stock keeping unit and stop at any point.
Characters which SHOULD NOT be matched MUST be replaced by either `?` (for a single character) or `*` (for zero or more characters).  
Two `*` MUST NOT follow each other.

##### Full Product Name Type - Product Identification Helper - Generic URIs

List of generic URIs (`x_generic_uris`) of value type `array` with at least 1 item contains a list of identifiers which are
either vendor-specific or derived from a standard not yet supported.

```
    "x_generic_uris": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    }  
```

Any such Generic URI item of value type `object` provides the two mandatory properties Namespace (`namespace`) and URI (`uri`).

```
        "properties": {
          "namespace": {
            // ...
          },
          "uri": {
            // ...
          }
        }
```

The namespace of the generic URI (`namespace`) of value type `string` with format `uri` refers to a URL which provides
the name and knowledge about the specification used or is the namespace in which these values are valid.

The URI (`uri`) of value type `string` with format `uri` contains the identifier itself.

> These elements can be used to reference a specific component from an SBOM:

*Example 1 (linking a component from a CycloneDX SBOM using the bomlink mechanism):*

```
          "x_generic_uris": [
            {
              "namespace": "https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/bomlink/",
              "uri": "urn:cdx:411dafd2-c29f-491a-97d7-e97de5bc2289/1#pkg:maven/org.jboss.logging/jboss-logging@3.4.1.Final?type=jar"
            }
          ]
```

*Example 2 (linking a component from an SPDX SBOM):*

```
          "x_generic_uris": [
            {
