### Profile Tests

This subsubsection structures the tests for the profiles. Not all tests apply for all profiles.
Tests SHOULD be skipped if the document category does not match the one given in the test.
Each of the following tests SHOULD be treated as they where listed similar to the other tests.

> An application MAY group these tests by profiles when providing the additional function to only run one or more selected tests.
> This results in one virtual test per profile.

#### Document Notes

It MUST be tested that at least one item in `/document/notes` exists which has a `category` of `description`, `details`, `general` or `summary`.

The relevant values for `/document/category` are:

```
  csaf_informational_advisory
  csaf_security_incident_response
```

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /document/notes
```

  > For the significance of the left pointing arrow character (`←`) at the end of a line in the following
  > example 1 please cf. the guidance in section [sec](#typographical-conventions).

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
  "notes": [
    {
      "category": "legal_disclaimer",

  ]
```

> The document notes do not contain an item which has a `category` of `description`, `details`, `general` or `summary`.

#### Document References

It MUST be tested that at least one item in `/document/references` exists that has links to an `external` source.

The relevant values for `/document/category` are:

```
  csaf_informational_advisory
  csaf_security_incident_response
```

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /document/references
```

  > For the significance of the left pointing arrow character (`←`) at the end of a line in the following
  > example 1 please cf. the guidance in section [sec](#typographical-conventions).
