### CVE in field IDs

For each item in `/vulnerabilities[]/ids` it MUST be tested that it is not a CVE ID.

> It is sufficient to check, whether the property `text` matches the regex `^CVE-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4,}$`.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/ids[]
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
      "ids": [
        {
          "system_name": "CVE Project",
          "text": "CVE-2021-44228"
        }
      ]
```

> The `CVE-2021-44228` is listed in an item of the `ids` array instead under `cve`.

> A tool MAY set such element as value for the `cve` property as a quick fix, if that didn't exist before.
> Alternatively, it MAY remove such element as a quick fix.
