### Inconsistent Exploitation Date

For each First Known Exploitation Dates item, it MUST be tested that the value of `exploitation_date` is earlier than or equal to value of the
sibling element `date`.
As the timestamps might use different timezones, the sorting MUST take timezones into account.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/first_known_exploitation_dates[]/exploitation_date
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
  "first_known_exploitation_dates": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-24T10:00:00.000Z",
      "exploitation_date": "2024-02-25T11:00:22.987Z",
      // ...
    }
  ]
```

> The value of `exploitation_date` is newer than the value of `date` in the same item.
