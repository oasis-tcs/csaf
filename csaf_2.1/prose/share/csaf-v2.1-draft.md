## 1.5 Typographical Conventions <a id='typographical-conventions'></a>

Keywords defined by this specification use this `monospaced` font.

```
    Normative source code uses this paragraph style.
```

Some sections of this specification are illustrated with non-normative examples introduced with "Example" or "Examples" like so:

*Example 1:*<a id='typographical-conventions-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-1-5-eg-1'></a><a id='example-4321'></a>

```
    Informative examples also use this paragraph style but preceded by the text "Example(s)".
```

All examples in this document are informative only.

All other text is normative unless otherwise labeled e.g. like the following informative comment:

> This is a pure informative comment that may be present, because the information conveyed is deemed useful advice or
> common pitfalls learned from implementer or operator experience and often given including the rationale.

# 2. Design Considerations <a id='design-considerations'></a>

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in JSON.

The term Security Advisory as used in this document describes any notification of security issues in products of and by providers.
Anyone providing a product is considered in this document as a vendor, i.e. developers or maintainers of information system products or services.
This includes all authoritative product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and distributors,
including authoritative vendor partners.
A security issue is not necessarily constrained to a problem statement, the focus of the term is on the security aspect impacting
(or not impacting) specific product-platform-version combinations.
Information on presence or absence of workarounds is also considered part of the security issue.
This document is the definitive reference for the language elements of CSAF version 2.1.
The encompassing JSON schema file noted in the Additional Artifacts section of the title page SHALL be taken as normative in the case
a gap or an inconsistency in this explanatory document becomes evident.
The following presentation in this section is grouped by topical area, and is not simply derivative documentation from the schema document itself.
The information contained aims to be more descriptive and complete.
Where applicable, common conventions are stated and known common issues in usage are pointed out informatively to support
implementers of document producers and consumers alike.

This minimal required information set does not provide any useful information on products, vulnerabilities, or security advisories.
Thus, any real-world Security Advisory will carry additional information as specified in section 3 Schema elements.

Care has been taken, to design the containers for product and vulnerability information to support fine-grained mapping of
security advisories onto product and vulnerability and minimize data duplication through referencing.
The display of the elements representing Product Tree and Vulnerability information has been placed in the sections named accordingly.

## 2.1 Construction Principles <a id='construction-principles'></a>

A Security Advisory defined as a CSAF document is the result of complex orchestration of many players and distinct and
partially difficult to play schemas.

The format chosen is [JSONSchema] which allows validation and delegation to sub schema providers.
The latter aligns well with separation of concerns and shares the format family of information interchange utilized by
the providers of product and vulnerability information which migrated from XML to JSON since the creation of CSAF CVRF version 1.2,
the pre-predecessor of this specification.

The acronym CSAF, âCommon Security Advisory Frameworkâ, stands for the target of concerted mitigation and remediation accomplishment.

Technically, the use of JSON schema allows validation and proof of model conformance (through established schema based validation)
of the declared information inside CSAF documents.

The CSAF schema structures its derived documents into three main classes of the information conveyed:

1. The frame, aggregation, and reference information of the document
2. Product information considered relevant by the creator
3. Vulnerability information and its relation to the products declared in 2.

Wherever possible repetition of data has been replaced by linkage through ID elements.
Consistency on the content level thus is in the responsibility of the producer of such documents,
to link e.g. vulnerability information to the matching product.

A dictionary like presentation of all defined schema elements is given in the section [3](#schema-elements).
Any expected relations to other elements (linkage) is described there. This linking relies on setting attribute values accordingly
(mostly guided by industry best practice and conventions) and thus implies,
that any deep validation on a semantic level (e.g. does the CWE match the described vulnerability)
is to be ensured by the producer and consumer of CSAF documents.
It is out of scope for this specification.

Proven and intended usage patterns from practice are given where possible.

Delegation to industry best practices technologies is used in referencing schemas for:

* Platform Data:
  * Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Version 2.3 \[[CPE23-N](#CPE23-N)\]
* Vulnerability Scoring:
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 4.0 \[[CVSS40](#CVSS40)\]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v4.0.json
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.1 \[[CVSS31](#CVSS31)\]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.json
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.0 \[[CVSS30](#CVSS30)\]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.json
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.0 \[[CVSS2](#CVSS2)\]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2.0.json
* Vulnerability Classification
  * Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) \[[CWE](#CWE)\]
    * CWE List: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html
* Classification for Document Distribution
  * Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)
    * Default Definition: https://www.first.org/tlp/

Even though the JSON schema does not prohibit specifically additional properties and custom keywords,
it is strongly recommended not to use them. Suggestions for new fields SHOULD be made through issues in the TC's GitHub.

> The standardized fields allow for scalability across different issuing parties and dramatically reduce the human effort and
> need for dedicated parsers as well as other tools on the side of the consuming parties.

Section [4](#profiles) defined profiles that are used to ensure a common understanding of which fields are required in a given use case.
Additional conventions are stated in section [5](#additional-conventions).
The tests given in section [6](#tests) support CSAF producers and
consumers to verify rules from the specification which can not be tested by the schema.
Section [7](#distributing-csaf-documents) states how to distribute and where to find CSAF documents.
Safety, Security and Data Protection are considered in section [8](#safety-security-and-data-protection-considerations).
Finally, a set of conformance targets describes tools in the ecosystem.


## 2.2 Date and Time <a id='date-and-time'></a>

This standard uses the `date-time` format as defined in JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 Section 7.3.1.
In accordance with [cite]{#RFC3339} and [cite]{#ISO8601}, the following rules apply:

* The letter `T` separating the date and time SHALL be upper case.
* The separator between date and time MUST be the letter `T`.
* The letter `Z` indicating the timezone UTC SHALL be upper case.
* Fractions of seconds are allowed as specified in the standards mention above with the full stop (`.`) as separator.
* Leap seconds are supported. However, they SHOULD be avoided if possible.
* Empty timezones MUST NOT be used.
* The ABNF of RFC 3339, section 5.6 applies.

-------

# 3. Schema Elements <a id='schema-elements'></a>

The CSAF schema describes how to represent security advisory information as a JSON document.

The CSAF schema Version 2.1 builds on the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 rules.

```
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
```

The schema identifier is:

```
    "$id": "https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.1/csaf_json_schema.json"
```

The further documentation of the schema is organized via Definitions and Properties.

* Definitions provide types that extend the JSON schema model
* Properties use these types to support assembling security advisories

Types and properties together provide the vocabulary for the domain specific language supporting security advisories.

The single mandatory property is `document`.
The optional two additional properties are `product_tree` and `vulnerabilities`.

## 3.1 Definitions <a id='definitions'></a>

The definitions (`$defs`) introduce the following domain specific types into the CSAF language:
Acknowledgments (`acknowledgments_t`), Branches (`branches_t`), Full Product Name (`full_product_name_t`), Language (`lang_t`), Notes (`notes_t`),
Product Group ID (`product_group_id_t`), Product Groups (`product_groups_t`), Product ID (`product_id_t`), Products (`products_t`),
References (`references_t`), and Version (`version_t`).

```
    "$defs": {
        "acknowledgments_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "branches_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "full_product_name_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "lang_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "notes_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "product_group_id_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "product_groups_t": {
             // ...
        },
        "product_id_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "products_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "references_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "version_t": {
            // ...
        }
    },
```

### 3.1.1 Acknowledgments Type <a id='acknowledgments-type'></a>

List of Acknowledgments (`acknowledgments_t`) type instances of value type `array` with 1 or more elements contain
a list of `Acknowledgment` elements.

```
    "acknowledgments_t": {

        // ...
      }
    },
```

The value type of Acknowledgment is `object` with at least 1 and at most 4 properties. Every such element acknowledges contributions by
describing those that contributed.
The properties are: `names`, `organization`, `summary`, and `urls`.

```
        "properties": {
          "names": {
            // ...
          },
          "organization": {

### 3.1.2 Branches Type <a id='branches-type'></a>

List of branches (`branches_t`) with value type `array` contains 1 or more branch elements as children of the current element.

```
    "branches_t": {
      //...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    },
```

Every Branch holds exactly 3 properties and is a part of the hierarchical structure of the product tree.
The properties `name` and `category` are mandatory. In addition, the object contains either a `branches` or a `product` property.

```
        "properties": {
          "branches": {
            // ...
          },
          "category": {

          "product": {
            // ...
          }
        }
```

> `branches_t` supports building a hierarchical structure of products that allows to indicate the relationship of products to each other and
> enables grouping for simpler referencing.
> As an example, the structure MAY use the following levels: `vendor` -> `product_family` -> `product_name` -> `product_version`.

#### 3.1.2.1 Branches Type - Branches <a id='branches-type-branches'></a>

List of branches (`branches`) has the value type `branches_t`.

#### 3.1.2.2 Branches Type - Category <a id='branches-type-category'></a>

Category of the branch (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` describes the characteristics of the labeled branch.
Valid `enum` values are:

```
    architecture
    host_name
    language
    legacy
    patch_level
    platform
    product_family
    product_name
    product_version
    product_version_range
    service_pack
    specification
    vendor
```

The value `architecture` indicates the architecture for which the product is intended.

The value `host_name` indicates the host name of a system/service.

The value `language` indicates the language of the product.

The value `legacy` indicates an entry that has reached its end of life.

The value `patch_level` indicates the patch level of the product.

The value `platform` indicates the (CPU) platform for which the product is intended.

The value `product_family` indicates the product family that the product falls into.

The value `product_name` indicates the name of the product.

The value `product_version` indicates exactly a single version of the product.
The value of the adjacent `name` property can be numeric or some other descriptor.
However, it MUST NOT contain version ranges of any kind.

> It is recommended to enumerate versions wherever possible. Nevertheless, the TC understands that this is sometimes impossible.
> To reflect that in the specification and aid in automatic processing of CSAF documents the value `product_version_range` was introduced.
> See next section for details.

The value `product_version_range` indicates a range of versions for the product.
The value of the adjacent `name` property SHOULD NOT be used to convey a single version.

The value `service_pack` indicates the service pack of the product.

The value `specification` indicates the specification such as a standard, best common practice, etc.

The value `vendor` indicates the name of the vendor or manufacturer that makes the product.

#### 3.1.2.3 Branches Type - Name <a id='branches-type-name'></a>

Name of the branch (`name`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters contains the canonical descriptor or 'friendly name' of the branch.

*Examples 1:*<a id='branches-type-name-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-1-2-3-eg-1'></a><a id='example-5'></a>

```
    10
    365
    Microsoft
    Office
    PCS 7
    SIMATIC
    Siemens
    Windows
```

A leading `v` or `V` in the value of `name` SHOULD only exist for the categories `product_version` or `product_version_range` if it is
part of the product version as given by the vendor.

##### 3.1.2.3.1 Branches Type - Name under Product Version <a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version'></a>

If adjacent property `category` has the value `product_version`, the value of `name` MUST NOT contain version ranges of any kind.

*Examples 1 (for `name` when using `product_version`):*<a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-1-2-3-1-eg-1'></a><a id='example-6'></a>

```

    17.4
    v3
```

> The `product_version` is the easiest way for users to determine whether their version is meant
> (provided that the given ancestors in the product tree matched):
> If both version strings are the same, it is a match - otherwise not.
> Therefore, it is always recommended to enumerate product versions instead of providing version ranges.

*Examples 2 (for `name` when using `product_version` which are invalid):*<a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-3-1-2-3-1-eg-2'></a><a id='example-7'></a>

```
    8.0.0 - 8.0.1
    8.1.5 and later
    <= 2
    prior to 4.2
    All versions < V3.0.29
    V3.0, V4.0, V4.1, V4.2
```

> All the examples above contain some kind of a version range and are therefore invalid under the category `product_version`.

##### 3.1.2.3.2 Branches Type - Name under Product Version Range <a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version-range'></a>

If adjacent property `category` has the value `product_version_range`, the value of `name` MUST contain version ranges.
The value of MUST obey to exactly one of the following options:

1. Version Range Specifier (vers)

    > vers is an ongoing community effort to address the problem of version ranges. Its draft specification is available at \[[VERS](#VERS)\].

    vers MUST be used in its canonical form. To convey the term "all versions" the special string `vers:all/*` MUST be used.

    *Examples 1 (for `name` when using `product_version_range` with vers):*<a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version-range-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-1-2-3-2-eg-1'></a><a id='example-8'></a>

    ```
        vers:gem/>=2.2.0|!= 2.2.1|<2.3.0
        vers:npm/1.2.3|>=2.0.0|<5.0.0
        vers:pypi/0.0.0|0.0.1|0.0.2|0.0.3|1.0|2.0pre1
        vers:tomee/>=8.0.0-M1|<=8.0.1
    ```

    > Through the definitions of the vers specification a user can compute whether a given version is in a given range.

2. Vers-like Specifier (vls)

    This option uses only the `<version-constraint>` part from the vers specification. It MUST NOT have an URI nor the `<versioning-scheme>` part.
    It is a fallback option and SHOULD NOT be used unless really necessary.
    > The reason for that is, that it is nearly impossible for tools to reliable determine whether a given version is in the range or not.

    Tools MAY support this on best effort basis.

    *Examples 2 (for `name` when using `product_version_range` with vls):*<a id='branches-type-name-under-product-version-range-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-3-1-2-3-2-eg-2'></a><a id='example-9'></a>

    ```

    "x_generic_uris": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    }  
```

Any such Generic URI item of value type `object` provides the two mandatory properties Namespace (`namespace`) and URI (`uri`).

```
        "properties": {
          "namespace": {
            // ...
          },
          "uri": {
            // ...
          }
        }
```

The namespace of the generic URI (`namespace`) of value type `string` with format `uri` refers to a URL which provides
the name and knowledge about the specification used or is the namespace in which these values are valid.

The URI (`uri`) of value type `string` with format `uri` contains the identifier itself.

### 3.1.4 Language Type <a id='language-type'></a>

Language type (`lang_t`) has value type `string` with `pattern` (regular expression):

```
    ^(([A-Za-z]{2,3}(-[A-Za-z]{3}(-[A-Za-z]{3}){0,2})?|[A-Za-z]{4,8})(-[A-Za-z]{4})?(-([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?(-([A-Za-z0-9]{5,8}|[0-9][A-Za-z0-9]{3}))*(-[A-WY-Za-wy-z0-9](-[A-Za-z0-9]{2,8})+)*(-[Xx](-[A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})+)?|[Xx](-[A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})+|[Ii]-[Dd][Ee][Ff][Aa][Uu][Ll][Tt]|[Ii]-[Mm][Ii][Nn][Gg][Oo])$
```

The value identifies a language, corresponding to IETF BCP 47 / RFC 5646.
See IETF language registry: <https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry>

> CSAF skips those grandfathered language tags that are deprecated at the time of writing the specification.
> Even though the private use language tags are supported they should not be used to ensure readability across the ecosystem.
> It is recommended to follow the conventions for the capitalization of the subtags even though it is not mandatory as most users are used to that.

```
    "references_t": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    },
```

Value type of every such Reference item is `object` with the mandatory properties `url` and `summary` holding any reference to conferences,
papers, advisories, and other resources that are related and considered related to either a surrounding part of or
the entire document and to be of value to the document consumer.
A reference `object` MAY provide the optional property `category`.

```

      },
      "url": {
        // ...
      }
    }
```

Category of reference (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` indicates whether the reference points to the same document or
vulnerability in focus (depending on scope) or to an external resource.
Valid `enum` values are:

```
    external
    self
```

The default value for `category` is `external`.

The value `external` indicates, that this document is an external reference to a document or vulnerability in focus (depending on scope).

The value `self` indicates, that this document is a reference to this same document or vulnerability (also depending on scope).

> This includes links to documents with the same content but different file format (e.g. advisories as PDF or HTML).

Summary of the reference (`summary`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters indicates what this reference refers to.

URL of reference (`url`) of value type `string` with format `uri` provides the URL for the reference.

### 3.1.11 Version Type <a id='version-type'></a>

The Version (`version_t`) type has value type `string` with `pattern` (regular expression):

```
    ^(0|[1-9][0-9]*)$|^((0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.(0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.(0|[1-9]\\d*)(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\\d*|\\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\\.(?:0|[1-9]\\d*|\\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?)$
```

The version specifies a version string to denote clearly the evolution of the content of the document.
There are two options how it can be used:

* semantic versioning (preferred; according to the rules below)
* integer versioning

A CSAF document MUST use only one versioning system.

*Examples 1:*<a id='version-type-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-eg-1'></a><a id='example-23'></a>

```
    1
    4
    0.9.0
    1.4.3
    2.40.0+21AF26D3
```

#### 3.1.11.1 Version Type - Integer versioning <a id='version-type-integer-versioning'></a>

Integer versioning increments for each version where the `/document/tracking/status` is `final` the version number by one.
The regular expression for this type is:

```
^(0|[1-9][0-9]*)$
```

The following rules apply:

1. Once a versioned document has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified.
   Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.
2. Version zero (0) is for initial development before the `initial_release_date`.
   The document status MUST be `draft`. Anything MAY change at any time. The document SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
3. Version 1 defines the initial public release.
   Each new version where `/document/tracking/status` is `final` has a version number incremented by one.
4. Pre-release versions (document status `draft`) MUST carry the new version number.
   Sole exception is before the initial release (see rule 2).
   The combination of document status `draft` and version 1 MAY be used to indicate that the content is unlikely to change.
5. Build metadata is never included in the version.
6. Precedence MUST be determined by integer comparison.

#### 3.1.11.2 Version Type - Semantic versioning <a id='version-type-semantic-versioning'></a>

Semantic versioning derived the rules from [SemVer]. The regular expression for this type is:

```
^((0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.(0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.(0|[1-9]\\d*)(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\\d*|\\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\\.(?:0|[1-9]\\d*|\\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?)$
```

The goal of this structure is to provide additional information to the end user whether a new comparison with the asset database is needed.
The "public API" in regards to CSAF is the CSAF document with its structure and content.
This results in the following rules:

1. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes.
   X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically.
   For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.
2. Once a versioned document has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified.
   Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.
3. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development before the `initial_release_date`.
   The document status MUST be `draft`. Anything MAY change at any time.
   The document SHOULD NOT be considered stable. Changes which would increment the major version according to rule 7 are
   tracked in this stage with (0.y.z) by incrementing the minor version y instead.
   Changes that would increment the minor or patch version according to rule 6 or 5 are both tracked in this stage with
   (0.y.z) by incrementing the patch version z instead.
4. Version 1.0.0 defines the initial public release.
   The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on the content and structure of
   the document and how it changes.
5. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.
   A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

   > In the context of the document this is the case e.g. for spelling mistakes.

6. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if the content of an existing element changes except for
   those which are covert through rule 7. It MUST be incremented if substantial new information are introduced or new elements are provided.
   It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.
7. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if a new comparison with the end user's asset database is required.
   This includes:

   * changes (adding, removing elements or modifying content) in `/product_tree` or elements which contain `/product_tree` in their path
   * adding or removing items of `/vulnerabilities`
   * adding or removing elements in:
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_affected`
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_affected`
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/last_affected`
   * removing elements from:
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_fixed`
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed`
     * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_not_affected`

   It MAY also include minor and patch level changes.
   Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.
8. A pre-release version (document status `draft`) MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately
   following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-].
   Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes.
   Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version.
   A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as
   denoted by its associated normal version.

   *Examples 1:*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-1'></a><a id='example-24'></a>

   ```
   1.0.0-0.3.7
   1.0.0-alpha
   1.0.0-alpha.1
   1.0.0-x-y-z.--
   1.0.0-x.7.z.92
   ```

9. Pre-release MUST NOT be included if `/document/tracking/status` is `final`.
10. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following
    the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-].
    Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence.
    Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence.

    *Examples 2:*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-2'></a><a id='example-25'></a>

    ```
    1.0.0+20130313144700
    1.0.0+21AF26D3----117B344092BD
    1.0.0-alpha+001
    1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85
    ```

11. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.

    1. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor,
       patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence).
    2. Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows:
       Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically.

       *Example 3:*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-3'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-3'></a><a id='example-26'></a>

       ```
       1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1
       ```

    3. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version:

       *Example 4:*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-4'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-4'></a><a id='example-27'></a>

       ```
       1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0
       ```

    4. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor,
       and patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows:

       1. Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically.
       2. Identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order.
       3. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.
       4. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.

       *Example 5:*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-5'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-5'></a><a id='example-28'></a>

       ```
       1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0
       ```

Note, that the following values do no conform the semantic versioning described above.

*Examples 6 (which are invalid):*<a id='version-type-semantic-versioning-eg-6'></a><a id='sec-3-1-11-2-eg-6'></a><a id='example-29'></a>

```
  1.16.13.14-Cor
  1.0.0-x-y-z.â
  1.0.0+21AF26D3â-117B344092BD
  2.5.20+3f93da6b+7cc
  3.20.0-00
```

## 3.2 Properties <a id='properties'></a>

These final four subsections document the four properties of a CSAF document.
The two mandatory properties `$schema` and `document`, as well as the optional properties `product_tree` and `vulnerabilities` in that order.

### 3.2.1 Schema Property <a id='schema-property'></a>

JSON schema (`$schema`) of value type `string` and `enum` with format `uri` contains the URL of the CSAF JSON schema which the document promises to be valid for.
The single valid value for this `enum` is:

```
  https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.1/csaf_json_schema.json
```

> This value allows for tools to identify that a JSON document is meant to be valid against this schema.
> Tools can use that to support users by automatically checking whether the CSAF adheres to the JSON schema identified by this URL.

### 3.2.2 Document Property <a id='document-property'></a>

Document level meta-data (`document`) of value type `object` with the 6 mandatory properties Category (`category`),
CSAF Version (`csaf_version`), Distribution (`distribution`), Publisher (`publisher`), Title (`title`),
and  Tracking (`tracking`) captures the meta-data about this document describing a particular set of security advisories.
In addition, the `document` object MAY provide the 6 optional properties Acknowledgments (`acknowledgments`),
Aggregate Severity (`aggregate_severity`), Language (`lang`), Notes (`notes`), References (`references`),
and Source Language (`source_lang`).

```
    "document": {
      // ...
      "properties": {
        "acknowledgments": {
          // ...
        },
        "aggregate_severity" : {
          // ...
        },
        "category": {
          // ...
        },
        "csaf_version": {
          // ...
        },
        "distribution": {
          // ...
        },
        "lang": {
          // ...
        },
        "notes": {
          // ...
        },
        "publisher": {
          // ...
        },
        "references": {
          // ...
        },
        "source_lang": {
          // ...
        },
        "title": {
          // ...
        },
        "tracking": {
          // ...
        }
      }
    },
```

#### 3.2.2.1 Document Property - Acknowledgments <a id='document-property-acknowledgments'></a>

Document acknowledgments (`acknowledgments`) of value type Acknowledgments Type (`acknowledgments_t`) contains
a list of acknowledgment elements associated with the whole document.

```
    "acknowledgments": {
      // ...
    },
```

#### 3.2.2.2 Document Property - Aggregate Severity <a id='document-property-aggregate-severity'></a>

Aggregate severity (`aggregate_severity`) of value type `object` with the mandatory property `text` and
the optional property `namespace` is a vehicle that is provided by the document producer to convey the urgency and
criticality with which the one or more vulnerabilities reported should be addressed.
It is a document-level metric and applied to the document as a whole â not any specific vulnerability.
The range of values in this field is defined according to the document producer's policies and procedures.

```
    "aggregate_severity": {
      // ...
      "properties": {
        "namespace": {
          // ...
        },
        "text": {
          // ...
        }
      }
    },
```

The Namespace of aggregate severity (`namespace`) of value type `string` with format `uri` points to the namespace so referenced.

The Text of aggregate severity (`text`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters provides a severity which is
independent of - and in addition to - any other standard metric for determining the impact or severity of a given vulnerability (such as CVSS).

*Examples 1:*<a id='document-property-aggregate-severity-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-2-eg-1'></a><a id='example-30'></a>

#### 3.2.2.3 Document Property - Category <a id='document-property-category'></a>

Document category (`category`) with value type `string` of 1 or more characters with `pattern` (regular expression):

```
    ^[^\\s\\-_\\.](.*[^\\s\\-_\\.])?$
```

Document category defines a short canonical name, chosen by the document producer, which will inform the end user as to the category of document.

> It is directly related to the profiles defined in section [4](#profiles).

```
    "category": {
      // ...
    }
```

*Examples 1:*<a id='document-property-category-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-3-eg-1'></a><a id='example-31'></a>

```
    csaf_base
    csaf_security_advisory

#### 3.2.2.4 Document Property - CSAF Version <a id='document-property-csaf-version'></a>

CSAF version (`csaf_version`) of value type `string` and `enum` gives the version of the CSAF specification which the document was generated for.
The single valid value for this `enum` is:

```

```

#### 3.2.2.5 Document Property - Distribution <a id='document-property-distribution'></a>

Rules for sharing document (`distribution`) of value type `object` with the mandatory property Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) (`tlp`) and the
optional properties Sharing Group (`Sharing Group`) and Text (`text`) describes any constraints on how this document might be shared.

```
    "distribution": {
      // ...
      "properties": {
        "sharing_group": {
          // ...
        },
        "text": {
          // ...
        },
        "tlp": {
          // ...
        }
      }
    },
```

If multiple values are present, the TLP information SHOULD be preferred as this aids in automation.
The Sharing Group SHALL be interpreted as specification to the TLP information.
Therefore, the Sharing Group MAY also be used to convey special TLP restrictions:

*Examples 1:*<a id='document-property-distribution-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-5-eg-1'></a><a id='example-32'></a>

```
    E-ISAC members-only
    Only releasable to European Energy sector
    Releasable to NATO countries
```

> Note that for such restrictions the Sharing Group Name MUST exist and all participants MUST know the associated Sharing Group IDs to allow for automation.

##### 3.2.2.5.1 Document Property - Distribution - Sharing Group <a id='document-property-distribution-sharing-group'></a>

Sharing Group (`sharing_group`) of value type `object` with the mandatory property Sharing Group ID (`id`) and
the optional property Sharing Group Name (`name`) contains information about the group this document is intended to be shared with.

```
        "sharing_group": {
          // ...
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              // ...
            },
            "name": {
              // ...
            }
          }
        },
```

Sharing Group ID (`id`) of value type `string` with format `uuid` and `pattern` (regular expression):

```
    ^(([0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-4[0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12})|([0]{8}-([0]{4}-){3}[0]{12})|([f]{8}-([f]{4}-){3}[f]{12}))$
```

Sharing Group ID provides the unique ID for the sharing group.
This ID is intended to be globally unique and MAY also be used by different issuing parties to share CSAF data within a closed group,
e.g. during a Multi-Party Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure case.

> Note, that participants in such cases usually differ. Therefore, it is advised to use one ID per case.
> Otherwise, the consequences of adding or removing parties from a case and the implications to other cases have to be considered.

The ID SHOULD NOT change throughout different CSAF documents, if the same sharing group is addressed.
It MUST differ if a different sharing group is addressed.

The ID SHALL be valid according to \[[RFC9562](#RFC9562)\] and recorded in the 8-4-4-4-12 notation in lower case.
The ID SHALL be a UUID Version 4 for any closed sharing group, i.e. `TLP:GREEN` and above.

The following ID values SHOULD NOT be used unless there are technical reasons for them.
Therefore, they are reserved for implementation-specific situations:

- A system MAY use the Max UUID for `TLP:CLEAR` CSAF documents.
  > For example, the system uses the UUID as an indication whether a user allowed to see the document.
  > The security considerations from \[[RFC9562](#RFC9562)\] should be reflected on.
- A system MAY use the Nil UUID for CSAF documents that MUST NOT be shared.
  > For example, the CSAF document is just being drafted and the accidental leakage should be prevented.

> Note, that both values do not indicate a closed sharing group.

A CSAF document with `TLP:CLEAR` SHOULD NOT contain a sharing group value and SHALL NOT contain any other value for the Sharing Group ID than Max UUID (`ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff`).

If an issuing party distributes multiple versions of a single CSAF document to different sharing groups, the rules for CSAF modifier (cf. section [sec](#conformance-clause-8-csaf-modifier)) regarding the generation of the value of `/document/tracking/id` SHALL be applied.
This implies that usually the sharing group ID is used as a prefix to the original `/document/tracking/id`.

Sharing Group Name (`name`) of value type `string` with one or more characters contains a human-readable name for the sharing group.

The Sharing Group Name is optional and can be chosen freely by the entity establishing the sharing group.
However, the following values are reserved for the conditions below:

- For the Max UUID, the value of `name` SHALL exist and be `Public`.
- For the Nil UUID, the value of `name` SHALL exist and be `No sharing allowed`.

##### 3.2.2.5.2 Document Property - Distribution - Text <a id='document-property-distribution-text'></a>

        },
        "url": {
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
```

The Label of TLP (`label`) with value type `string` and `enum` provides the TLP label of the document.
Valid values of the `enum` are:

```
    AMBER
    AMBER+STRICT
    CLEAR
    GREEN
    RED
```

> Note: In the TLP specification there are only 4 labels. The part `+STRICT` is an extension to `TLP:AMBER`.
> To simplify the JSON structure, avoid additional business level tests and aid in parsing, consumption and
> processing, it is provided as a label to be selected instead of having a separate field.

The default value for `label` is `CLEAR`.

> Note: This provides the suggested default value for anyone writing CSAF documents as the majority of those
> are intended to be publicly available.

The URL of TLP version (`url`) with value type `string` with format `uri` provides a URL where to find
the textual description of the TLP version which is used in this document.
The default value is the URL to the definition by FIRST:

```
    https://www.first.org/tlp/
```

*Examples 1:*<a id='document-property-distribution-tlp-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-5-3-eg-1'></a><a id='example-34'></a>

A single multiplier might have target audiences.
> For example, a National CSIRT might create different CSAF documents for the same vulnerability for critical
  infrastructure companies in different sectors, government agencies, non-critical industry, and the public based on
  information sharing agreements and threats to the target group.
  
The creation step can make use of a CSAF modifier that replaces metadata, e.g. the document publisher.
Currently, this value includes multipliers, republishers, and forwarders.

The value `translator` indicates individuals or organizations that translate CSAF documents.
This includes all manner of language translators, also those who work for the party issuing the original advisory.

an incremented (patch) version which has no other changes than:

* the new publisher information
* the updated revision history
* the updated item in `/document/references[]` which points to the new version of the CSAF document
* an added item in `/document/references[]` which points to the previous version of the CSAF document (if the URL changed)

              // ...
            }
          }
        },
```

Date of document generation (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` SHOULD be the current date that the document was generated.
Because documents are often generated internally by a document producer and exist for a nonzero amount of time before being released,
this field MAY be different from the Initial Release Date and Current Release Date.

Engine of document generation (`engine`) of value type `object` with mandatory property Engine name (`name`) and
optional property Engine version (`version`) contains information about the engine that generated the CSAF document.

```

    Red Hat rhsa-to-cvrf
    Secvisogram
    TVCE
```

Engine version (`version`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters contains the version of the engine that generated the CSAF document.

> Although it is not formally required, the TC suggests to use a versioning which is compatible with Semantic Versioning as described in
> the external specification [SemVer]. This could help the end user to identify when CSAF consumers have to be updated.

*Examples 2:*<a id='document-property-tracking-generator-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-12-3-eg-2'></a><a id='example-41'></a>

```
    ^[\\S](.*[\\S])?$
```

Unique identifier for the document holds the Identifier.

> It SHALL NOT start or end with a white space and SHALL NOT contain a line break.

The ID is a simple label that provides for a wide range of numbering values, types, and schemes.
Its value SHOULD be assigned and maintained by the original document issuing authority. It MUST be unique for that organization.

*Examples 1:*<a id='document-property-tracking-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-3-2-2-12-4-eg-1'></a><a id='example-42'></a>

```

> The combination of `/document/publisher/namespace` and `/document/tracking/id` identifies a CSAF document globally unique.

This value is also used to determine the filename for the CSAF document (cf. section [5.1](#filename)).

##### 3.2.2.12.5 Document Property - Tracking - Initial Release Date <a id='document-property-tracking-initial-release-date'></a>

Initial release date (`initial_release_date`) with value type `string` with format `date-time` holds the date when this document was first published.

##### 3.2.2.12.6 Document Property - Tracking - Revision History <a id='document-property-tracking-revision-history'></a>

The Revision History (`revision_history`) with value type `array` of 1 or more Revision History Entries holds one revision item for each version of
the CSAF document, including the initial one.

```
        "revision_history": {
          // ...
          "items": {
            // ...
          }
        },
```

Each Revision contains all the information elements required to track the evolution of a CSAF document.
Revision History Entry items are of value type `object` with the three mandatory properties: Date (`date`), Number (`number`),
and Summary (`summary`).
In addition, a Revision MAY expose the optional property `legacy_version`.

```
        "properties": {
          "date": {
            // ...
          },
          "legacy_version": {
            // ...
          },
          "number": {
            // ...
          },
          "summary": {
            // ...
          }
        }
```

The Date of the revision (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` states the date of the revision entry.

Legacy version of the revision (`legacy_version`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters contains the version string used
in an existing document with the same content.

> This SHOULD be used to aid in the mapping between existing (human-readable) documents which might use a different version scheme and
> CSAF documents with the same content.
> It is recommended, to use the CSAF revision number to describe the revision history for any new human-readable equivalent.

The Number (`number`) has value type Version (`version_t`).

The Summary of the revision (`summary`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters holds a single non-empty string representing
a short description of the changes.

Each Revision item which has a `number` of `0` or `0.y.z` MUST be removed from the document if the document status is `final`.
Versions of the document which are pre-release SHALL NOT have its own revision item.
All changes MUST be tracked in the item for the next release version.
Build metadata SHOULD NOT be included in the `number` of any revision item.

##### 3.2.2.12.7 Document Property - Tracking - Status <a id='document-property-tracking-status'></a>

Document status (`status`) of value type `string` and `enum` defines the draft status of the document.
The value MUST be one of the following:

```
    draft
    final
    interim
```

The value `draft` indicates, that this is a pre-release, intended for issuing party's internal use only,
or possibly used externally when the party is seeking feedback or indicating its intentions regarding a specific issue.

The value `final` indicates, that the issuing party asserts the content is unlikely to change.
âFinalâ status is an indication only, and does not preclude updates.
This SHOULD be used if the issuing party expects no, slow or few changes.

The value `interim` indicates, that the issuing party expects rapid updates.
This SHOULD be used if the expected rate of release for this document is significant higher than for other documents.
Once the rate slows down it MUST be changed to `final`. This MAY be done in a patch version.

> This is extremely useful for downstream vendors to constantly inform the end users about ongoing investigation.
> It can be used as an indication to pull the CSAF document more frequently.

##### 3.2.2.12.8 Document Property - Tracking - Version <a id='document-property-tracking-version'></a>

Version has the value type Version (`version_t`).

### 3.2.3 Product Tree Property <a id='product-tree-property'></a>

```

The given values reflect the VEX not affected justifications. See [VEX-Justification] for more details. The values MUST be used as follows:

* `component_not_present`: The software is not affected because the vulnerable component is not in the product.
* `vulnerable_code_not_present`: The product is not affected because the code underlying the vulnerability is not present in the product.
  > Unlike `component_not_present`, the component in question is present, but for whatever reason (e.g. compiler options)
  > the specific code causing the vulnerability is not present in the component.
* `vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary`: The vulnerable component is present, and the component contains the vulnerable code.
  However, vulnerable code is used in such a way that an attacker cannot mount any anticipated attack.
* `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`: The affected code is not reachable through the execution of the code,
  including non-anticipated states of the product.
  > Components that are neither used nor executed by the product.
* `inline_mitigations_already_exist`: Built-in inline controls or mitigations prevent an adversary from leveraging the vulnerability.

```
    "involvements": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    },
```

Every Involvement item of value type `object` with the 2 mandatory properties Party (`party`), Status (`status`) and
the 2 optional properties Date of involvement (`date`) and Summary (`summary`) is a container that allows the document producers to
comment on the level of involvement (or engagement) of themselves (or third parties) in the vulnerability identification, scoping,
and remediation process.
It can also be used to convey the disclosure timeline.
The ordered tuple of the values of `party` and `date` (if present) SHALL be unique within `involvements`.

        }
```

Date of involvement (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` holds the date and time of the involvement entry.

Party category (`party`) of value type `string` and `enum` defines the category of the involved party.
Valid values are:

```
    coordinator
    discoverer
    other
    user
    vendor
```

These values follow the same definitions as given for the publisher category (cf. section [3.2.2.8.1](#document-property-publisher-category)).

Party status (`status`) of value type `string` and `enum` defines contact status of the involved party.
Valid values are:

```
    completed
    contact_attempted
    disputed
    in_progress
    not_contacted
    open
```

Each status is mutually exclusive - only one status is valid for a particular vulnerability at a particular time. As the vulnerability ages,
a party's involvement could move from state to state.
However, in many cases, a document producer may choose not to issue CSAF documents at each state, or simply omit this element altogether.
It is recommended, however, that vendors that issue CSAF documents indicating an open or in-progress involvement SHOULD eventually expect to issue
a document containing one of the statuses `disputed` or `completed` as the latest one.

> The two vulnerability involvement status states, `contact_attempted` and `not_contacted` are intended for use by document producers other than
> vendors (such as research or coordinating entities).

The value `completed` indicates that the party asserts that investigation of the vulnerability is complete.
No additional information, fixes, or documentation from the party about the vulnerability should be expected to be released.

The value `contact_attempted` indicates that the document producer attempted to contact the party.

The value `disputed` indicates that the party disputes the vulnerability report in its entirety.
This status SHOULD be used when the party believes that a vulnerability report regarding a product is completely inaccurate
(that there is no real underlying security vulnerability) or that the technical issue being reported has no security implications.

The value `in_progress` indicates that some hotfixes, permanent fixes, mitigations, workarounds,
or patches may have been made available by the party, but more information or fixes may be released in the future.
The use of this status by a vendor indicates that future information from the vendor about the vulnerability is to be expected.

The value `not_contacted` indicates that the document producer has not attempted to make contact with the party.

The value `open` is the default status.
It doesnât indicate anything about the vulnerability remediation effort other than the fact that the party has acknowledged awareness of
the vulnerability report.
The use of this status by a vendor indicates that future updates from the vendor about the vulnerability are to be expected.

Summary of involvement (`summary`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters contains additional context regarding what is going on.

#### 3.2.4.8 Vulnerabilities Property - Metrics <a id='vulnerabilities-property-metrics'></a>

List of metrics (`metrics`) of value type `array` with 1 or more unique items (a set) of value type `object` Contains metric objects for the current vulnerability.

```
    "metrics": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    },
```

Every Metric item of value type `object` with the mandatory properties `content` and `products` and the optional property `source` contains all metadata about the metric including products it applies to and the source and the content itself.

##### 3.2.4.13.1 Vulnerabilities Property - Remediations - Category <a id='vulnerabilities-property-remediations-category'></a>

Category of the remediation (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` specifies the category which this remediation belongs to.
Valid values are:

```
    fix_planned
    mitigation
    no_fix_planned
    none_available
    optional_patch
    vendor_fix
    workaround
```

The value `workaround` indicates that the remediation contains information about a configuration or specific deployment scenario that
can be used to avoid exposure to the vulnerability. There MAY be none, one, or more workarounds available.
This is typically the âfirst line of defenseâ against a new vulnerability before a mitigation or vendor fix has been issued or even discovered.

The value `mitigation` indicates that the remediation contains information about a configuration or deployment scenario that
helps to reduce the risk of the vulnerability but that does not resolve the vulnerability on the affected product.
Mitigations MAY include using devices or access controls external to the affected product.
Mitigations MAY or MAY NOT be issued by the original author of the affected product,
and they MAY or MAY NOT be officially sanctioned by the document producer.

The value `vendor_fix` indicates that the remediation contains information about an official fix that
is issued by the original author of the affected product.
Unless otherwise noted, it is assumed that this fix fully resolves the vulnerability.

The value `optional_patch` indicates that the remediation contains information about an patch that
is issued by the original author of the affected product.
Its application is not necessary, but might be desired by the user, e.g. to calm a security scanner by
updating a dependency to a fixed version even though the dependency in the affected version was used
in the product in a way that the product itself was not affected.
Unless otherwise noted, it is assumed that this does not change the state regarding the vulnerability.

> This is sometimes also referred to as a "regulatory compliance patch".

The value `none_available` indicates that there is currently no fix or other remediation available.
The text in field `details` SHOULD contain details about why there is no fix or other remediation.

The value `fix_planned` indicates that there is a fix for the vulnerability planned but not yet ready.
An issuing party might choose to use this category to announce that a fix is currently developed.
The text in field `details` SHOULD contain details including a date when a customer can expect the fix to be ready and distributed.

The value `no_fix_planned` indicates that there is no fix for the vulnerability and it is not planned to provide one at any time.
This is often the case when a product has been orphaned, declared end-of-life, or otherwise deprecated.
The text in field `details` SHOULD contain details about why there will be no fix issued.

Some category values contradict each other and thus are mutually exclusive per product.
Therefore, such a combination MUST NOT be used in the list of remediations for the same product.
This is independent from whether the product is referenced directly or indirectly through a product group.
The following tables shows the allowed and prohibited combinations:

| category value   | `workaround` | `mitigation` | `vendor_fix` | `optional_patch` | `none_available` | `fix_planned` | `no_fix_planned` |
|:----------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|

| `no_fix_planned` | allowed      | allowed      | prohibited   | prohibited       | prohibited       | prohibited    | allowed          |

Some category values contradict certain product status groups.
Therefore, such a combination MUST NOT exist in a vulnerability item for the same product.
This is independent from whether the product is referenced directly or indirectly through a product group.
The following tables shows the allowed, discouraged and prohibited combinations:

| category value   | Affected   | Not Affected | Fixed       | Under Investigation | Recommended |

                    // ...
                  }
                },
```

Every Entitlement of the remediation contains any possible vendor-defined constraints for obtaining fixed software or hardware that
fully resolves the vulnerability.

##### 3.2.4.13.5 Vulnerabilities Property - Remediations - Group IDs <a id='vulnerabilities-property-remediations-group-ids'></a>

        }
      },
```

Category of restart (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` specifies what category of restart is required by
this remediation to become effective.
Valid values are:

```
    connected
    dependencies
    machine
    none
    parent
    service
    system
    vulnerable_component
    zone
```

The values MUST be used as follows:

* `none`: No restart required.
* `vulnerable_component`: Only the vulnerable component (as given by the elements of `product_ids` or `group_ids` in the current remediation item)
   needs to be restarted.
* `service`: The vulnerable component and the background service used by the vulnerable component need to be restarted.
* `parent`: The vulnerable component and its parent process need to be restarted. This could be the case if the parent process has no build-in way
  to restart the vulnerable component or process values / context is only given at the start of the parent process.
* `dependencies`: The vulnerable component and all components which require the vulnerable component to work need to be restarted.
  This could be the case e.g. for a core service of a software.
* `connected`: The vulnerable component and all components connected (via network or any type of inter-process communication)
  to the vulnerable component need to be restarted.
* `machine`: The machine on which the vulnerable component is installed on needs to be restarted.
  This is the value which SHOULD be used if an OS needs to be restarted.
  It is typically the case for OS upgrades.
* `zone`: The security zone in which the machine resides on which the vulnerable component is installed needs to be restarted.
  This value might be useful for a remediation if no patch is available.
  If the malware can be wiped out by restarting the infected machines but the infection spreads fast the controlled shutdown of all machines at
  the same time and restart afterwards can leave one with a clean system.
* `system`: The whole system which the machine resides on which the vulnerable component is installed needs to be restarted.
  This MAY include multiple security zones. This could be the case for a major system upgrade in an ICS system or a protocol change.

Additional restart information (`details`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters provides additional information for the restart.
This can include details on procedures, scope or impact.

##### 3.2.4.13.8 Vulnerabilities Property - Remediations - URL <a id='vulnerabilities-property-remediations-url'></a>

```
    "threats": {
      // ...
      "items": {
        // ...
      }
    },
```

Every Threat item of value type `object` with the two mandatory properties Category (`category`) and Details (`details`) contains
the vulnerability kinetic information.
This information can change as the vulnerability ages and new information becomes available.
In addition, any Threat item MAY expose the three optional properties Date (`date`), Group IDs (`group_ids`), and Product IDs (`product_ids`).

```
    "properties": {
      "category": {
        // ...

Category of the threat (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` categorizes the threat according to the rules of the specification.
Valid values are:

```
    exploit_status
    impact
    target_set
```

The value `exploit_status` indicates that the `details` field contains a description of the degree to which an exploit for the vulnerability is known.
This knowledge can range from information privately held among a very small group to an issue that has been described to the public at
a major conference or is being widely exploited globally.
For consistency and simplicity, this section can be a mirror image of the CVSS `exploitMaturity` (v4.0),
respectively `exploitCodeMaturity` (v3.1 and v3.0) or `exploitability` (v2.0) metric.
However, it can also contain a more contextual status, such as "Weaponized" or "Functioning Code".

The value `impact` indicates that the `details` field contains an assessment of the impact on the user or the target set if
the vulnerability is successfully exploited or a description why it cannot be exploited.
If applicable, for consistency and simplicity, this section can be a textual summary of the three CVSS impact metrics.
These metrics measure how a vulnerability detracts from the three core security properties of an information system:
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

The value `target_set` indicates that the `details` field contains a description of
the currently known victim population in whatever terms are appropriate.
Such terms MAY include: operating system platform, types of products, user segments, and geographic distribution.

Date of the threat (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` contains the date when the assessment was done or the threat appeared.

Details of the threat (`details`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters represents a thorough human-readable discussion of the threat.

Group IDs (`group_ids`) are of value type Product Groups (`product_groups_t`) and contain a list of Product Groups the current threat item applies to.

# 4. Profiles <a id='profiles'></a>

CSAF documents do not have many required fields as they can be used for different purposes.
To ensure a common understanding of which fields are required in a given use case the standard defines profiles.
Each subsection describes such a profile by describing necessary content for that specific use case and providing insights into its purpose.
The value of `/document/category` is used to identify a CSAF document's profile. The following rules apply:

1. Each CSAF document MUST conform the **CSAF Base** profile.
2. Each profile extends the base profile "CSAF Base" - directly or indirect through another profile from the standard - by making additional
   fields from the standard mandatory.
   A profile can always add, but never subtract nor overwrite requirements defined in the profile it extends.
3. Any optional field from the standard can also be added to a CSAF document which conforms with a profile without breaking conformance with
   the profile.
   One and only exempt is when the profile requires not to have a certain set of fields.
4. Values of `/document/category` starting with `csaf_` are reserved for existing, upcoming and future profiles defined in the CSAF standard.
5. Values of `/document/category` that do not match any of the values defined in section [4](#profiles) of this standard SHALL be validated against
   the "CSAF Base" profile.
6. Local or private profiles MAY exist and tools MAY choose to support them.
7. If an official profile and a private profile exists, tools MUST validate against the official one from the standard.

## 4.1 Profile 1: CSAF Base <a id='profile-1-csaf-base'></a>

This profile defines the default required fields for any CSAF document.
Therefore, it is a "catch all" for CSAF documents that do not satisfy any other profile.
Furthermore, it is the foundation all other profiles are build on.

A CSAF document SHALL fulfill the following requirements to satisfy the profile "CSAF Base":

* The following elements MUST exist and be valid:
  * `/$schema`
  * `/document/category`
  * `/document/csaf_version`
  * `/document/distribution/tlp/label`
  * `/document/publisher/category`
  * `/document/publisher/name`
  * `/document/publisher/namespace`
  * `/document/title`
  * `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
  * `/document/tracking/id`
  * `/document/tracking/initial_release_date`
  * `/document/tracking/revision_history[]/date`
  * `/document/tracking/revision_history[]/number`
  * `/document/tracking/revision_history[]/summary`
  * `/document/tracking/status`
  * `/document/tracking/version`
* The value of `/document/category` SHALL NOT be equal to any value that is intended to only be used by another profile nor to the
  (case insensitive) name of any other profile from the standard.
  This does not differentiate between underscore, dash or whitespace.
  To explicitly select the use of this profile the value `csaf_base` SHOULD be used.

> Neither `CSAF Security Advisory` nor `csaf security advisory` are valid values for `/document/category`.

An issuing party might choose to set `/document/publisher/name` in front of a value that is intended to only be used by another
profile to state that the CSAF document does not use the profile associated with this value.
In this case, the (case insensitive) string "CSAF" MUST be removed from the value.
This SHOULD be done if the issuing party is unable or unwilling to use the value `csaf_base`, e.g. due to legal or cooperate identity reasons.

> Both values `Example Company Security Advisory` and `Example Company security_advisory` in `/document/category` use the profile "CSAF Base".
> This is important to prepare forward compatibility as later versions of CSAF might add new profiles.
> Therefore, the values which can be used for the profile "CSAF Base" might change.

## 4.2 Profile 2: Security incident response <a id='profile-2-security-incident-response'></a>

This profile SHOULD be used to provide a response to a security breach or incident.
This MAY also be used to convey information about an incident that is unrelated to the issuing party's own products or infrastructure.

> Example Company might use a CSAF document satisfying this profile to respond to a security incident at ACME Inc. and
the implications on its own products and infrastructure.

A CSAF document SHALL fulfill the following requirements to satisfy the profile "Security incident response":

* The following elements MUST exist and be valid:
  * all elements required by the profile "CSAF Base".
  * `/document/notes` with at least one item which has a `category` of `description`, `details`, `general` or `summary`
    > Reasoning: Without at least one note item which contains information about response to the event referred to this doesn't provide
    > any useful information.
  * `/document/references` with at least one item which has a `category` of `external`
    > The intended use for this field is to refer to one or more documents or websites which provides more details about the incident.
* The value of `/document/category` SHALL be `csaf_security_incident_response`.

## 4.3 Profile 3: Informational Advisory <a id='profile-3-informational-advisory'></a>

This profile SHOULD be used to provide information which are **not related to a vulnerability** but e.g. a misconfiguration.

A CSAF document SHALL fulfill the following requirements to satisfy the profile "Informational Advisory":

* The following elements MUST exist and be valid:
  * all elements required by the profile "CSAF Base".
  * `/document/notes` with at least one item which has a `category` of `description`, `details`, `general` or `summary`
    > Reasoning: Without at least one note item which contains information about the "issue" which is the topic of the advisory it is useless.
  * `/document/references` with at least one item which has a `category` of `external`
    > The intended use for this field is to refer to one or more documents or websites which provide more details about
    > the issue or its remediation (if possible).
    > This could be a hardening guide, a manual, best practices or any other helpful information.
* The value of `/document/category` SHALL be `csaf_informational_advisory`.
* The element `/vulnerabilities` SHALL NOT exist.
  If there is any information that would reside in the element `/vulnerabilities` the CSAF document SHOULD use another profile,
  e.g. "Security Advisory".

If the element `/product_tree` exists, a user MUST assume that all products mentioned are affected.

## 4.4 Profile 4: Security Advisory <a id='profile-4-security-advisory'></a>

This profile SHOULD be used to provide information which is related to vulnerabilities and corresponding remediations.

A CSAF document SHALL fulfill the following requirements to satisfy the profile "Security Advisory":

* The following elements MUST exist and be valid:
  * all elements required by the profile "CSAF Base".
  * `/product_tree` which lists all products referenced later on in the CSAF document regardless of their state.
  * `/vulnerabilities` which lists all vulnerabilities.
  * `/vulnerabilities[]/notes`
    > Provides details about the vulnerability.
  * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status`
    > Lists each product's status in regard to the vulnerability.
* The value of `/document/category` SHALL be `csaf_security_advisory`.

## 4.5 Profile 5: VEX <a id='profile-5-vex'></a>

This profile SHOULD be used to provide information of the "Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange".
The main purpose of the VEX format is to state that and why a certain product is, or is not, affected by a vulnerability.
See \[[VEX](#VEX)\] for details.

A CSAF document SHALL fulfill the following requirements to satisfy the profile "VEX":

* The following elements MUST exist and be valid:
  * all elements required by the profile "CSAF Base".
  * `/product_tree` which lists all products referenced later on in the CSAF document regardless of their state.
  * `/vulnerabilities` which lists all vulnerabilities.
  * at least one of
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed`
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_affected`
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_not_affected`
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/under_investigation`
  * at least one of
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/cve`
    * `/vulnerabilities[]/ids`
  * `/vulnerabilities[]/notes`
    > Provides details about the vulnerability.
* For each item in
  * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_not_affected` an impact statement SHALL exist as machine readable flag
    in `/vulnerabilities[]/flags` or as human readable justification in `/vulnerabilities[]/threats`.
    For the latter one, the `category` value for such a statement MUST be `impact` and the `details` field SHALL contain
    a description why the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
  * `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_affected` additional product specific information SHALL be provided
    in `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations` as an action statement.
    Optional, additional information MAY also be provide through `/vulnerabilities[]/notes` and `/vulnerabilities[]/threats`.
    > The use of the categories `no_fix_planned` and `none_available` for an action statement is permitted.
  > Even though Product status lists Product IDs, Product Group IDs can be used in the `remediations` and `threats` object.
  > However, it MUST be ensured that for each Product ID the required information according to its product status as stated
  > in the two points above is available. This implies that all products with the status `known_not_affected` MUST have an
  > impact statement and all products with the status `known_affected` MUST have additional product specific information
  > regardless of whether that is referenced through the Product ID or a Product Group ID.
* The value of `/document/category` SHALL be `csaf_vex`.

# 5. Additional Conventions <a id='additional-conventions'></a>

This section provides additional rules for handling CSAF documents.

## 5.1 Filename <a id='filename'></a>

The following rules MUST be applied to determine the filename for the CSAF document:

1. The value `/document/tracking/id` is converted into lower case.
2. Any character sequence which is not part of one of the following groups MUST be replaced by a single underscore (`_`):
   * Lower case ASCII letters (0x61 - 0x7A)
   * digits (0x30 - 0x39)
   * special characters: `+` (0x2B), `-` (0x2D)
   > The regex `[^+\-a-z0-9]+` can be used to find a character sequence which has to be replaced by an underscore.
   > However, it SHALL NOT be applied before completing the first step.
   >
   > Even though the underscore `_` (0x5F) is a valid character in the filename it is replaced to avoid situations
   > where the conversion rule might lead to multiple consecutive underscores.
   > As a result, a `/document/tracking/id` with the value `2022_#01-A` is converted into `2022_01-a` instead of `2022__01-a`.
3. The file extension `.json` MUST be appended.

*Examples 1:*<a id='filename-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-5-1-eg-1'></a><a id='example-50'></a>

```
  cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot.json
  example_company_-_2019-yh3234.json
  rhba-2019_0024.json
```

> It is currently considered best practice to indicate that a CSAF document is invalid by
> inserting `_invalid` into the filename in front of the file extension.

*Examples 2:*<a id='filename-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-5-1-eg-2'></a><a id='example-51'></a>

```
  cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot_invalid.json
  example_company_-_2019-yh3234_invalid.json
  rhba-2019_0024_invalid.json
```

## 5.2 Separation in Data Stream <a id='separation-in-data-stream'></a>

If multiple CSAF documents are transported via a data stream in a sequence without requests inbetween,
they MUST be separated by the Record Separator in accordance with \[[RFC7464](#RFC7464)\].

## 5.3 Sorting <a id='additional-conventions--sorting'></a>

The keys within a CSAF document SHOULD be sorted alphabetically.

## 5.4 Usage of Markdown <a id='usage-of-markdown'></a>

The use of GitHub-flavoured Markdown is permitted in the following fields:

```
  /document/acknowledgments[]/summary
  /document/distribution/text
  /document/notes[]/text
  /document/publisher/issuing_authority
  /document/references[]/summary
  /document/tracking/revision_history[]/summary
  /product_tree/product_groups[]/summary
  /vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments[]/summary
  /vulnerabilities[]/involvements[]/summary
  /vulnerabilities[]/notes[]/text
  /vulnerabilities[]/references[]/summary
  /vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/details
  /vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/entitlements[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/restart_required/details
  /vulnerabilities[]/threats[]/details
```

Other fields MUST NOT contain Markdown.

## 5.5 Branch recursion <a id='branch-recursion'></a>

The `/product_tree` uses a nested structure for `branches`. Along a single path to a leaf, the recursion of `branches` is limited to 30 repetitions. Therefore, the longest path to a leaf is:

```
/product_tree/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/branches[]/product
```

# 6. Tests <a id='tests'></a>

The following three subsections list a number of tests which all will have a short description and an excerpt of an example which fails the test.

## 6.1 Mandatory Tests <a id='mandatory-tests'></a>

Mandatory tests MUST NOT fail at a valid CSAF document.
A program MUST handle a test failure as an error.

### 6.1.1 Missing Definition of Product ID <a id='missing-definition-of-product-id'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/product_id_t` which is not inside a Full Product Name (type: `full_product_name_t`) and
therefore reference an element within the `product_tree` it MUST be tested that the Full Product Name element with the matching `product_id` exists.
The same applies for all items of elements of type `/$defs/products_t`.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/product_groups[]/product_ids[]
  /product_tree/relationships[]/product_reference
  /product_tree/relationships[]/relates_to_product_reference
  /vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]/products[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_affected[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_fixed[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_affected[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_not_affected[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/last_affected[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/recommended[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/under_investigation[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/product_ids[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/threats[]/product_ids[]
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='missing-definition-of-product-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-1-eg-1'></a><a id='example-52'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "product_groups": [
      {
        "group_id": "CSAFGID-1020300",
        "product_ids": [
          "CSAFPID-9080700",
          "CSAFPID-9080701"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

> Neither `CSAFPID-9080700` nor `CSAFPID-9080701` were defined in the `product_tree`.

### 6.1.2 Multiple Definition of Product ID <a id='multiple-definition-of-product-id'></a>

For each Product ID (type `/$defs/product_id_t`) in Full Product Name elements (type: `/$defs/full_product_name_t`) it
MUST be tested that the `product_id` was not already defined within the same document.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/product/product_id
  /product_tree/full_product_names[]/product_id
  /product_tree/relationships[]/full_product_name/product_id
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='multiple-definition-of-product-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-2-eg-1'></a><a id='example-53'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product A"
      },
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product B"
      }
    ]
  }
```

> `CSAFPID-9080700` was defined twice.

### 6.1.3 Circular Definition of Product ID <a id='circular-definition-of-product-id'></a>

For each new defined Product ID (type `/$defs/product_id_t`) in items of relationships (`/product_tree/relationships`) it
MUST be tested that the `product_id` does not end up in a circle.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /product_tree/relationships[]/full_product_name/product_id
```

> As this can be quite complex a program for large CSAF documents, a program could check first whether
> a Product ID defined in a relationship item is used as `product_reference` or `relates_to_product_reference`.
> Only for those which fulfill this condition it is necessary to run the full check following the references.

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='circular-definition-of-product-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-3-eg-1'></a><a id='example-54'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product A"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "category": "installed_on",
        "full_product_name": {
          "name": "Product B",
          "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080701"
        },
        "product_reference": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "relates_to_product_reference": "CSAFPID-9080701"
      }
    ]
  }
```

> `CSAFPID-9080701` refers to itself - this is a circular definition.

### 6.1.4 Missing Definition of Product Group ID <a id='missing-definition-of-product-group-id'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/product_group_id_t` which is not inside a Product Group (`/product_tree/product_groups[]`) and
therefore reference an element within the `product_tree` it MUST be tested that the Product Group element with the matching `group_id` exists.
The same applies for all items of elements of type `/$defs/product_groups_t`.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/group_ids
  /vulnerabilities[]/threats[]/group_ids
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='missing-definition-of-product-group-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-4-eg-1'></a><a id='example-55'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product A"
      }
    ]
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "threats": [
        {
          "category": "exploit_status",
          "details": "Reliable exploits integrated in Metasploit.",
          "group_ids": [
            "CSAFGID-1020301"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> `CSAFGID-1020301` was not defined in the Product Tree.

### 6.1.5 Multiple Definition of Product Group ID <a id='multiple-definition-of-product-group-id'></a>

For each Product Group ID (type `/$defs/product_group_id_t`) Product Group elements (`/product_tree/product_groups[]`) it
MUST be tested that the `group_id` was not already defined within the same document.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /product_tree/product_groups[]/group_id
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='multiple-definition-of-product-group-id-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-5-eg-1'></a><a id='example-56'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [

      },
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080701",
        "name": "Product B"
      },
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080702",
        "name": "Product C"
      }
    ],
    "product_groups": [
      {
        "group_id": "CSAFGID-1020300",
        "product_ids": [
          "CSAFPID-9080700",
          "CSAFPID-9080701"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group_id": "CSAFGID-1020300",
        "product_ids": [
          "CSAFPID-9080700",
          "CSAFPID-9080702"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

> `CSAFGID-1020300` was defined twice.

### 6.1.6 Contradicting Product Status <a id='contradicting-product-status'></a>

For each item in `/vulnerabilities` it MUST be tested that the same Product ID is not member of contradicting product status groups.
The sets formed by the contradicting groups within one vulnerability item MUST be pairwise disjoint.

Contradiction groups are:

* Affected:

   ```
   /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_affected[]  
   /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_affected[]
   /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/last_affected[]
   ```

* Not affected:

  ```
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/known_not_affected[]
  ```

* Fixed:

  ```
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_fixed[]
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed[]
  ```

* Under investigation:

  ```
  /vulnerabilities[]/product_status/under_investigation[]
  ```

> Note: An issuer might recommend (`/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/recommended`) a product version from any group - also from the affected group,
> i.e. if it was discovered that fixed versions introduce a more severe vulnerability.

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='contradicting-product-status-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-6-eg-1'></a><a id='example-57'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product A"
      }
    ]
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "product_status": {

        ],
        "known_not_affected": [
          "CSAFPID-9080700"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
```

> `CSAFPID-9080700` is a member of the two contradicting groups "Affected" and "Not affected".

### 6.1.7 Multiple Scores with same Version per Product <a id='multiple-scores-with-same-version-per-product'></a>

For each item in `/vulnerabilities` it MUST be tested that the same Product ID is not member of more than one CVSS-Vectors with the same version and same source.

> Different source might assign different scores for the same product.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='multiple-scores-with-same-version-per-product-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-7-eg-1'></a><a id='example-58'></a>

```

### 6.1.14 Sorted Revision History <a id='sorted-revision-history'></a>

It MUST be tested that the value of `number` of items of the revision history are sorted ascending when the items are sorted
ascending by `date` and as a second level criteria `number`.
As the timestamps might use different timezones, the sorting MUST take timezones into account.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /document/tracking/revision_history
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='sorted-revision-history-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-14-eg-1'></a><a id='example-65'></a>

and underscore characters are removed from the values on both sides before the match.
Also the value MUST NOT start with the reserved prefix `csaf_` except if the value is `csaf_base`.

This test does only apply for CSAF documents with the profile "CSAF Base".
Therefore, it MUST be skipped if the document category matches one of the values defined for the profile other than "CSAF Base".

> For CSAF 2.0, the test must be skipped for the following values in `/document/category`:
>
> ```
>   csaf_base
>   csaf_security_incident_response
>   csaf_informational_advisory
>   csaf_security_advisory
>   csaf_vex
> ```

  /document/source_lang
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='translation-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-28-eg-1'></a><a id='example-90'></a>

```
  "document": {
    // ...
    "lang": "en-US",
    // ...
    "source_lang": "en-US",
    // ...
  }
```

> The document language and the source language have the same value `en-US`.
>
> Note: A translation from `en-US` to `en-GB` would pass the test.

> A tool MAY remove the source language as quick fix.

### 6.1.29 Remediation without Product Reference <a id='remediation-without-product-reference'></a>

For each item in `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations` it MUST be tested that it includes at least one of the elements `group_ids` or `product_ids`.

      "version": "2"
    }
```

> The document started with semantic versioning (`1.0.0`) and switched to integer versioning (`2`).

> A tool MAY assign all items their corresponding value according to integer versioning as a quick fix.
> In such case, the old `number` SHOULD be stored in `legacy_version`.

### 6.1.31 Version Range in Product Version <a id='version-range-in-product-version'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/branches_t` with `category` of `product_version` it MUST be tested that
the value of `name` does not contain a version range.

> To implement this test it is deemed sufficient that, when converted to lower case, the value of `name` satisfies the two requirements below:
>
> 1. It does not contain any of the following operators:
>
>    ```
>      <
>      <=
>      >
>      >=
>    ```
>
> 2. If interpreted as a list of individual words separated by whitespace, the list does not contain any of the following keywords:
>
>    ```
>      after
>      all
>      before
>      earlier
>      later
>      prior
>      versions
>    ```

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/name

### 6.1.33 Multiple Flags with VEX Justification Codes per Product <a id='multiple-flags-with-vex-justification-codes-per-product'></a>

For each item in `/vulnerabilities[]` it MUST be tested that a Product is not member of more than one Flag item with
a VEX justification code (see section [3.2.4.5](#vulnerabilities-property-flags)).
This takes indirect relations through Product Groups into account.

> Additional flags with a different purpose might be provided in later versions of CSAF.
> Through the explicit reference of VEX justification codes the test is specified to be forward-compatible.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/flags
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='multiple-flags-with-vex-justification-codes-per-product-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-1-33-eg-1'></a><a id='example-95'></a>

### 6.2.26 Usage of CWE Allowed with Review for Vulnerability Mapping <a id='usage-of-cwe-allowed-with-review-for-vulnerability-mapping'></a>

For each item in the CWE array it MUST be tested that the vulnerability mapping is allowed without review.

> Reasoning: CWEs marked with a vulnerability mapping state of `Allowed-with-Review` should only be used if a thorough review was done.
> This test helps to flag such mappings which can be used to trigger processes that ensure the extra review, e.g. by a senior analyst.

The relevant path for this test is:

```

For each item in the list of metrics which contains the `cvss_v2` object under `content` it MUST be tested that is not the only scoring item present.
The test SHALL pass if a second scoring object is available regarding the specific product.

> One source might just provide CVSS v2.
> As long as at least one different source provides a different scoring system for the same products, the test passes.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /vulnerabilities[]/metrics
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='use-of-cvss-v2-as-the-only-scoring-system-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-1-eg-1'></a><a id='example-135'></a>

```
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-9080700",
        "name": "Product A"
      }
    ]
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "metrics": [
        {

          "products": [
            "CSAFPID-9080700"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> There is only a CVSS v2 score given for `CSAFPID-9080700`.

Recommendation:

It is recommended to (also) use the CVSS v4.0.

### 6.3.2 Use of CVSS v3.0 <a id='use-of-cvss-v3-0'></a>

For each item in the list of metrics which contains the `cvss_v3` object under `content` it MUST be tested that CVSS v3.0 is not used.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]/content/cvss_v3/version
  /vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]/content/cvss_v3/vectorString
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='use-of-cvss-v3-0-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-2-eg-1'></a><a id='example-136'></a>

```
  "cvss_v3": {
    "version": "3.0",
    "vectorString": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",
    "baseScore": 6.5,
    "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"
  }
```

> The CVSS v3.0 is used.

Recommendation:

It is recommended to upgrade to CVSS v3.1.

> A tool MAY upgrade to CVSS v3.1 as quick fix.
> However, if such quick fix is supported the tool SHALL also recompute the `baseScore` and `baseSeverity`.
> The same applies for `temporalScore` and `temporalSeverity` respectively `environmentalScore` and `environmentalSeverity` if
> the necessary fields for computing their value are present and set.

### 6.3.3 Missing CVE <a id='missing-cve'></a>

It MUST be tested that the CVE number is given.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/cve
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='missing-cve-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-3-eg-1'></a><a id='example-137'></a>

```
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "title": "BlueKeep"
    }
  ]
```

> The CVE number is not given.

Recommendation:

It is recommended to provide a CVE number to support the users efforts to find more details about a vulnerability and
potentially track it through multiple advisories.
If no CVE exists for that vulnerability, it is recommended to get one assigned.

### 6.3.4 Missing CWE <a id='missing-cwe'></a>

It MUST be tested that the CWE is given.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/cwe
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='missing-cwe-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-4-eg-1'></a><a id='example-138'></a>

```
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-0708",
      "title": "BlueKeep"
    }
  ]
```

> The CWE number is not given.

### 6.3.5 Use of Short Hash <a id='use-of-short-hash'></a>

It MUST be tested that the length of the hash value is not shorter than 64 characters.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/product/product_identification_helper/hashes[]/file_hashes[]/value
  /product_tree/full_product_names[]/product_identification_helper/hashes[]/file_hashes[]/value

            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

> The length of the hash value is only 32 characters long.

### 6.3.6 Use of non-self referencing URLs Failing to Resolve <a id='use-of-non-self-referencing-urls-failing-to-resolve'></a>

For each URL which is not in the category `self` it MUST be tested that it resolves with a HTTP status code from
the 2xx (Successful) or 3xx (Redirection) class.

> This test does not apply for any item in an array of type `references_t` with the category `self`.
> For details about the HTTP status code classes see \[[RFC7231](#RFC7231)\].

The relevant paths for this test are:

    ]
```

> The `category` is not set and therefore treated as its default value `external`.
> A request to that URL does not resolve with a status code from the 2xx (Successful) or 3xx (Redirection) class.

### 6.3.7 Use of self referencing URLs Failing to Resolve <a id='use-of-self-referencing-urls-failing-to-resolve'></a>

For each item in an array of type `references_t` with the category `self` it MUST be tested that
the URL referenced resolves with a HTTP status code less than 400.

> This test will most likely fail if the CSAF document is in a status before the initial release.

      }
    ]
```

> The `category` is `self` and a request to that URL does not resolve with a status code from the 2xx (Successful) or 3xx (Redirection) class.

### 6.3.8 Spell check <a id='spell-check'></a>

If the document language is given it MUST be tested that a spell check for the given language does not find any mistakes.
The test SHALL be skipped if not document language is set. It SHALL fail it the given language is not supported.
The value of `/document/category` SHOULD NOT be tested if the CSAF document does not use the profile "CSAF Base".

  }
```

> There is a spelling mistake in `Secruity`.

### 6.3.9 Branch Categories <a id='branch-categories'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/full_product_name_t` in `/product_tree/branches` it MUST be tested that
ancestor nodes along the path exist which use the following branch categories `vendor` -> `product_name` -> `product_version` in that
order starting with the Product tree node.

> Other branch categories can be used before, after or between the aforementioned branch categories without making the test invalid.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='branch-categories-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-9-eg-1'></a><a id='example-143'></a>

            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```

> The product `CSAFPID-9080700` does not have any ancestor with the branch category `product_version`.

### 6.3.10 Usage of Product Version Range <a id='usage-of-product-version-range'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/branches_t` it MUST be tested that the `category` is not `product_version_range`.

> It is usually hard decide for machines whether a product version matches a product version ranges.
> Therefore, it is recommended to avoid version ranges and enumerate versions wherever possible.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/category
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='usage-of-product-version-range-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-10-eg-1'></a><a id='example-144'></a>

```
                "category": "product_version_range",
```

> The category `product_version_range` was used.

### 6.3.11 Usage of V as Version Indicator <a id='usage-of-v-as-version-indicator'></a>

For each element of type `/$defs/branches_t` with `category` of `product_version` it MUST be tested that
the value of `name` does not start with `v` or `V` before the version.

> To implement this test it is deemed sufficient that the value of `name` does not match the following regex:
>
> ```
>   ^[vV][0-9].*$
> ```

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /product_tree/branches[](/branches[])*/name
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='usage-of-v-as-version-indicator-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-11-eg-1'></a><a id='example-145'></a>

                // ...
              }
            ]
```

> The product version starts with a `v`.

### 6.3.12 Missing CVSS v4.0 <a id='missing-cvss-v4-0'></a>

For each item in the list of metrics it MUST be tested that a `cvss_v4` object is present.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]/content
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*<a id='missing-cvss-v4-0-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-6-3-12-eg-1'></a><a id='example-146'></a>

# 7. Distributing CSAF documents <a id='distributing-csaf-documents'></a>

This section lists requirements and roles defined for distributing CSAF documents.
The first subsection provides all requirements - the second one the roles.
It is mandatory to fulfill the basic role "CSAF publisher". The last section provides specific rules for the process of retrieving CSAF documents.

## 7.1 Requirements <a id='requirements'></a>

The requirements in this subsection are consecutively numbered to be able to refer to them directly.
The order does not give any hint about the importance.
Not all requirements have to be fulfilled to conform to this specification - the sets of
requirements per conformance clause are defined in section [7.2](#roles).

### 7.1.1 Requirement 1: Valid CSAF document <a id='requirement-1-valid-csaf-document'></a>

The document is a valid CSAF document (cf. Conformance clause 1).

### 7.1.2 Requirement 2: Filename <a id='requirement-2-filename'></a>

The CSAF document has a filename according to the rules in section [5.1](#filename).

### 7.1.3 Requirement 3: TLS <a id='requirement-3-tls'></a>

The CSAF document is per default retrievable from a website which uses TLS for encryption and server authenticity.
The CSAF document MUST NOT be downloadable from a location which does not encrypt the transport when crossing organizational
boundaries to maintain the chain of custody.

### 7.1.4 Requirement 4: TLP:CLEAR <a id='requirement-4-tlp-clear'></a>

If the CSAF document is labeled TLP:CLEAR, it MUST be freely accessible.

This does not exclude that such a document is also available in an access protected customer portal.
However, there MUST be one copy of the document available for people without access to the portal.

> Reasoning: If an advisory is already in the media, an end user should not be forced to collect the pieces of information from a
> press release but be able to retrieve the CSAF document.

### 7.1.5 Requirement 5: TLP:AMBER, TLP:AMBER+STRICT and TLP:RED <a id='requirement-5-tlp-amber-tlp-amber+strict-and-tlp-red'></a>

CSAF documents labeled TLP:AMBER, TLP:AMBER+STRICT or TLP:RED MUST be access protected.
If they are provided via a web server this SHALL be done under a different path than for TLP:CLEAR,
TLP:GREEN and unlabeled CSAF documents. TLS client authentication, access tokens or any other automatable authentication method SHALL be used.

An issuing party MAY agree with the recipients to use any kind of secured drop at the recipients' side to avoid putting them on their own website.
However, it MUST be ensured that the documents are still access protected.

### 7.1.6 Requirement 6: No Redirects <a id='requirement-6-no-redirects'></a>

Redirects SHOULD NOT be used. If they are inevitable only HTTP Header redirects are allowed.

> Reasoning: Clients should not parse the payload for navigation and some, as e.g. `curl`, do not follow any other kind of redirects.

If any redirects are used, there SHOULD not be more than 5 and MUST NOT be more than 10 consecutive redirects.

### 7.1.7 Requirement 7: provider-metadata.json <a id='requirement-7-provider-metadata-json'></a>

The party MUST provide a valid `provider-metadata.json` according to the schema
[CSAF provider metadata](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/provider_json_schema.json) for its own metadata.
The `publisher` object SHOULD match the one used in the CSAF documents of the issuing party but can be set to whatever value a
CSAF aggregator SHOULD display over any individual `publisher` values in the CSAF documents themselves.

> This information is used to collect the data for CSAF aggregators, listers and end users.
> The CSAF provider metadata schema ensures the consistency of the metadata for a CSAF provider across the ecosystem.
> Other approaches, like extracting the `publisher` object from CSAF documents, are likely to fail if the object differs between CSAF documents.
>
> It is suggested to put the file `provider-metadata.json` adjacent to the ROLIE feed documents (requirement 15)
> or in the main directory adjacent to the year folders (requirement 14), `changes.csv` (requirement 13) and the `index.txt` (requirement 12).
> Suggested locations to store the `provider-metadata.json` are:
>
> * https://www.example.com/.well-known/csaf/provider-metadata.json
> * https://domain.tld/security/data/csaf/provider-metadata.json
> * https://psirt.domain.tld/advisories/csaf/provider-metadata.json
> * https://domain.tld/security/csaf/provider-metadata.json

*Example 1 (minimal with ROLIE document):*<a id='requirement-7-provider-metadata-json-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-7-eg-1'></a><a id='example-147'></a>

      "name": "Example Company ProductCERT",
      "namespace": "https://psirt.example.com"
    },
    "role": "csaf_trusted_provider"
  }
```

If a CSAF publisher (cf. section [7.2.1](#role-csaf-publisher)) does not provide the `provider-metadata.json`,
an aggregator SHOULD contact the CSAF publisher in question to determine the values for `list_on_CSAF_aggregators` and `mirror_on_CSAF_aggregators`.
If that is impossible or if the CSAF publisher is unresponsive the following values MUST be used:

```
    "list_on_CSAF_aggregators": true,
    "mirror_on_CSAF_aggregators": false
```

> This prevents that CSAF documents of a CSAF publisher which have been collected by one CSAF aggregator A are mirrored again on a
> second CSAF aggregator B. Such cascades are prone to outdated information.
> If the first aggregator A collects the CSAF documents on best effort and B copies the files from A and announces that this is done weekly,
> one might assume that B's CSAF documents are more recent.
> However, that is not the case as B's information depends on A.

### 7.1.8 Requirement 8: security.txt <a id='requirement-8-security-txt'></a>

In the security.txt there MUST be at least one field `CSAF` which points to the `provider-metadata.json` (requirement 7).
If this field indicates a web URI, then it MUST begin with "https://" (as per section 2.7.2 of \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230)\]).
See \[[SECURITY-TXT](#SECURITY-TXT)\] for more details.

> The security.txt was published as \[[RFC9116](#RFC9116)\] in April 2022.
> The `CSAF` field was officially added through the IANA registry.

*Examples 1:*<a id='requirement-8-security-txt-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-8-eg-1'></a><a id='example-148'></a>

```
CSAF: https://domain.tld/security/data/csaf/provider-metadata.json
CSAF: https://psirt.domain.tld/advisories/csaf/provider-metadata.json
CSAF: https://domain.tld/security/csaf/provider-metadata.json
CSAF: https://www.example.com/.well-known/csaf/provider-metadata.json
```

It is possible to advertise more than one `provider-metadata.json` by adding multiple `CSAF` fields,
e.g. in case of changes to the organizational structure through merges or acquisitions.
However, this SHOULD NOT be done and removed as soon as possible.
If one of the URLs fulfills requirement 9, this MUST be used as the first CSAF entry in the security.txt.

### 7.1.9 Requirement 9: Well-known URL for provider-metadata.json <a id='requirement-9-well-known-url-for-provider-metadata-json'></a>

The URL path `/.well-known/csaf/provider-metadata.json` under the main domain of the issuing authority serves directly
the `provider-metadata.json` according to requirement 7. That implies that redirects SHALL NOT be used.
The use of the scheme "HTTPS" is required. See \[[RFC8615](#RFC8615)\] for more details.

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-9-well-known-url-for-provider-metadata-json-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-9-eg-1'></a><a id='example-149'></a>

```
  https://www.example.com/.well-known/csaf/provider-metadata.json
```

### 7.1.10 Requirement 10: DNS path <a id='requirement-10-dns-path'></a>

The DNS record `csaf.data.security.domain.tld` SHALL resolve as a web server which serves directly
the `provider-metadata.json` according to requirement 7. That implies that redirects SHALL NOT be used.
The use of the scheme "HTTPS" is required.

### 7.1.11 Requirement 11: One folder per year <a id='requirement-11-one-folder-per-year'></a>

The CSAF documents MUST be located within folders named `<YYYY>` where `<YYYY>` is the year given in the
value of `/document/tracking/initial_release_date`.

*Examples 1:*<a id='requirement-11-one-folder-per-year-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-11-eg-1'></a><a id='example-150'></a>

```
2024
2023
```

### 7.1.12 Requirement 12: index.txt <a id='requirement-12-index-txt'></a>

The index.txt file within MUST provide a list of all filenames of CSAF documents which are located in the sub-directories with their filenames.

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-12-index-txt-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-12-eg-1'></a><a id='example-151'></a>

```
2023/esa-2023-09953.json
2022/esa-2022-02723.json
2021/esa-2021-31916.json
2021/esa-2021-03676.json
```

> This can be used to download all CSAF documents.

### 7.1.13 Requirement 13: changes.csv <a id='requirement-13-changes-csv'></a>

The file `changes.csv` contains a list of CSAF documents in the current TLP level that were changed recently.
Therefore, it MUST contain the filename as well as the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date` for each
CSAF document in the sub-directories without a heading; lines MUST be sorted by the `current_release_date` timestamp with the latest one first.
The `changes.csv` SHALL be a valid comma separated values format as defined by \[[RFC4180](#RFC4180)\] without double quotes.

> Note: As a consequence of section [sec](#requirement-2-filename) Requirement 2 for filenames and section [sec](#requirement-11-one-folder-per-year)
> Requirement for directory names, there must not be any characters within the `changes.csv` that would require quoting.

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-13-changes-csv-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-13-eg-1'></a><a id='example-152'></a>

```

```

> Note: As CSAF 2.0 requires quotes, an \[[RFC4180](#RFC4180)\] parser can read both format revisions.

### 7.1.14 Requirement 14: Directory listings <a id='requirement-14-directory-listings'></a>

Directory listing SHALL be enabled to support manual navigation.

### 7.1.15 Requirement 15: ROLIE feed <a id='requirement-15-rolie-feed'></a>

Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) is a standard to ease discovery of security content.
ROLIE is built on top of the Atom Publishing Format and Protocol, with specific requirements that support publishing security content.
All CSAF documents with the same TLP level MUST be listed in a single ROLIE feed.
At least one of the feeds

* TLP:CLEAR
* TLP:GREEN
* unlabeled

MUST exist.
Each ROLIE feed document MUST be a JSON file that conforms with \[[RFC8322](#RFC8322)\].

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-15-rolie-feed-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-15-eg-1'></a><a id='example-153'></a>

Any existing hash file (requirement 18) MUST be listed in the corresponding entry of the ROLIE feed as an item of
the array `link` having the `rel` value of `hash`.
Any existing signature file (requirement 19) MUST be listed in the corresponding entry of the ROLIE feed as an item of the array `link`
having the `rel` value of `signature`.

### 7.1.16 Requirement 16: ROLIE service document <a id='requirement-16-rolie-service-document'></a>

The use and therefore the existence of ROLIE service document is optional.
If it is used, each ROLIE service document MUST be a JSON file that conforms with \[[RFC8322](#RFC8322)\] and lists the ROLIE feed documents.
Additionally, it can also list the corresponding ROLIE category documents.
The ROLIE service document SHOULD use the filename `service.json` and reside next to the `provider-metadata.json`.

The use and therefore the existence of ROLIE category document is optional.
If it is used, each ROLIE category document MUST be a JSON file that conforms with \[[RFC8322](#RFC8322)\].
A ROLIE category document SHOULD reside next to the corresponding ROLIE feed.
ROLIE categories SHOULD be used for to further dissect CSAF documents by one or more of the following criteria:

* document category
* document language
* values of the branch category within the Product Tree including but not limited to
  * `vendor`
  * `product_family`
  * `product_name`

            "term": "Example Company Product B"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

### 7.1.18 Requirement 18: Integrity <a id='requirement-18-integrity'></a>

All CSAF documents SHALL have at least one hash file computed with a secure cryptographic hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-512 or SHA-3)
to ensure their integrity. The filename is constructed by appending the file extension which is given by the algorithm.

MD5 and SHA1 SHOULD NOT be used.

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-18-integrity-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-18-eg-1'></a><a id='example-158'></a>

```
File name of CSAF document: esa-2022-02723.json
File name of SHA-256 hash file: esa-2022-02723.json.sha256
File name of SHA-512 hash file: esa-2022-02723.json.sha512
```

The file content SHALL start with the first byte of the hexadecimal hash value.
Any subsequent data (like a filename) which is optional SHALL be separated by at least one space.

*Example 2:*<a id='requirement-18-integrity-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-7-1-18-eg-2'></a><a id='example-159'></a>

```
ea6a209dba30a958a78d82309d6cdcc6929fcb81673b3dc4d6b16fac18b6ff38  esa-2022-02723.json
```

If a ROLIE feed exists, each hash file MUST be listed in it as described in requirement 15.

### 7.1.19 Requirement 19: Signatures <a id='requirement-19-signatures'></a>

All CSAF documents SHALL have at least one OpenPGP signature file which is provided under the same filename which is
extended by the appropriate extension.
This signature SHALL be presented as an ASCII armored file.
See \[[RFC4880](#RFC4880)\] for more details.

*Example 1:*<a id='requirement-19-signatures-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-7-1-19-eg-1'></a><a id='example-160'></a>

```
File name of CSAF document: esa-2022-02723.json
File name of signature file: esa-2022-02723.json.asc
```

If a ROLIE feed exists, each signature file MUST be listed in it as described in requirement 15.

At all times, signatures MUST remain valid for a minimum of 30 days and ideally for at least 90 days. When executing
CSAF document signatures, the signing party SHOULD adhere to or surpass the prevailing best practices and recommendations
regarding key length.
Tools SHOULD treat the violation of the rules given in the first sentence as:

* warning if the signature is only valid for 90 days or less at the time of the verification,
* error, which MAY be ignored by the user per option, if the signature is only valid for 30 days or less at the time of
  the verification and
* error if the signature is expired at the time of the verification.

### 7.1.20 Requirement 20: Public OpenPGP Key <a id='requirement-20-public-openpgp-key'></a>

The public part of the OpenPGP key used to sign the CSAF documents MUST be available.
This key file SHALL be presented as an ASCII armored file.
It SHOULD also be available at a public key server.

> For example, the public part of the OpenPGP key could be placed in a directory `openpgp` adjacent to the `provider-metadata.json`.

The OpenPGP key SHOULD have a strength that is considered secure.

> Guidance on OpenPGP key strength can be retrieved from technical guidelines of competent authorities.

### 7.1.21 Requirement 21: List of CSAF providers <a id='requirement-21-list-of-csaf-providers'></a>

The file `aggregator.json` MUST be present and valid according to the
JSON schema [CSAF aggregator](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/aggregator_json_schema.json).
It MUST NOT be stored adjacent to a `provider-metadata.json`.

> Suggested locations to store the `aggregator.json` are:
>
> * https://www.example.com/.well-known/csaf-aggregator/aggregator.json
> * https://domain.tld/security/data/aggregator/csaf/aggregator.json
> * https://psirt.domain.tld/advisories/aggregator/csaf/aggregator.json
> * https://domain.tld/security/aggregator/csaf/aggregator.json

The file `aggregator.json` SHOULD only list the latest version of the metadata of a CSAF provider.

### 7.1.22 Requirement 22: Two disjoint issuing parties <a id='requirement-22-two-disjoint-issuing-parties'></a>

The file `aggregator.json` (requirement 21) lists at least two disjoint CSAF providers (including CSAF trusted providers)
or one CSAF publisher and one CSAF provider (including CSAF trusted provider).

### 7.1.23 Requirement 23: Mirror <a id='requirement-23-mirror'></a>

The CSAF documents for each issuing party that is mirrored MUST be in a different folder.
The folder name SHOULD be retrieved from the name of the issuing authority.
This folders MUST be adjacent to the `aggregator.json` (requirement 21).
Each such folder MUST at least:

* provide a `provider-metadata.json` for the current issuing party.
* provide the ROLIE feed document according to requirement 15 which links to the local copy of the CSAF document.

### 7.1.24 Requirement 24: HTTP User-Agent <a id='requirement-24-http-user-agent'></a>

Access to the CSAF related files and directories provided, for both metadata and documents, MUST be allowed independent of the
value of HTTP User-Agent.

> Limit the value of HTTP User-Agents to a certain set would hinder adoption of tools retrieving the files.

The only exception is that the temporary blocking of certain HTTP User-Agents is allowed to mitigate an ongoing security incident
(e.g. a DoS attack on the web server serving the CSAF files).
However, a less severe measure with a similar effect SHOULD be used.
CSAF related files and directories SHOULD be exempted from temporary blocking.
The temporary blocking SHOULD be removed as soon as possible, at latest two weeks after the security incident process was completed.

> Also confer to the TC's guidance on content delivery networks and caching.

## 7.2 Roles <a id='roles'></a>

This subsection groups the requirements from the previous subsection into named sets which target the roles with the same name.
This allows end users to request their suppliers to fulfill a certain set of requirements.
A supplier can use roles for advertising and marketing.

The roles "CSAF publisher", "CSAF provider", and "CSAF trusted provider" are intended directly for issuing parties and form the first group.
The second group consists of the roles "CSAF lister" and "CSAF aggregator".
They collect data from the aforementioned issuing parties of the first group and provide them in a single place to aid in automation.
Parties of the second group can also issue their own advisories.
However, they MUST follow the rules for the first group for that.

Both, a CSAF lister and a CSAF aggregator, decide based on their own rules which issuing parties to list respectively to mirror.
However, an issuing party MAY apply to be listed or mirrored.

Issuing parties MUST indicate through the value `false` in `list_on_CSAF_aggregators` if they do not want to be listed.
Issuing parties MUST indicate through the value `false` in `mirror_on_CSAF_aggregators` if they do not want to be mirrored.

The values are independent.
The combination of the value `false` in `list_on_CSAF_aggregators` and `true` in `mirror_on_CSAF_aggregators` implies that
the issuing party does not want to be listed without having the CSAF documents mirrored.
Therefore, a CSAF aggregator can list that issuing party if it mirrors the files.

### 7.2.1 Role: CSAF publisher <a id='role-csaf-publisher'></a>

A distributing party satisfies the "CSAF publisher" role if the party:

* satisfies the requirements 1 to 4 in section [7.1](#requirements).
* distributes only CSAF documents on behalf of its own.

### 7.2.2 Role: CSAF provider <a id='role-csaf-provider'></a>

A CSAF publisher satisfies the "CSAF provider" role if the party fulfills the following three groups of requirements:

Firstly, the party:

* satisfies the "CSAF publisher" role profile.
* additionally satisfies the requirements 5 to 7 and 24 in section [7.1](#requirements).

Secondly, the party:

* satisfies at least one of the requirements 8 to 10 in section [7.1](#requirements).

Thirdly, the party:

* satisfies the requirements 11 to 14 in section [7.1](#requirements) or requirements 15 to 17 in section [7.1](#requirements).

> If the party uses the ROLIE-based distribution, it MUST also satisfy requirements 15 to 17.
> If it uses the directory-based distribution, it MUST also satisfy requirements 11 to 14.

### 7.2.3 Role: CSAF trusted provider <a id='role-csaf-trusted-provider'></a>

A CSAF provider satisfies the "CSAF trusted provider" role if the party:

* satisfies the "CSAF provider" role profile.
* additionally satisfies the requirements 18 to 20 in section [7.1](#requirements).

### 7.2.4 Role: CSAF lister <a id='role-csaf-lister'></a>

A distributing party satisfies the "CSAF lister" role if the party:

* satisfies the requirements 6, 21, 22 and 24 in section [7.1](#requirements).
* uses the value `lister` for `/aggregator/category`.
* does not list any mirror pointing to a domain under its own control.

> The purpose of this role is to provide a list of URLs where to find CSAF documents.
> It is not assumed that the list will be complete.

### 7.2.5 Role: CSAF aggregator <a id='role-csaf-aggregator'></a>

A distributing party satisfies the "CSAF aggregator" role if the party:

* satisfies the requirements 1 to 6 and 21 to 24 in section [7.1](#requirements).
* uses the value `aggregator` for `/aggregator/category`.
* lists a mirror for at least two disjoint issuing parties pointing to a domain under its own control.
* links the public part of the OpenPGP key used to sign CSAF documents for each mirrored issuing party in
  the corresponding `provider-metadata.json`.
* provides for each CSAF document that is mirrored a signature (requirement 19) and a hash (requirement 18).
  Both SHALL be listed in the ROLIE feed. If the issuing party provides those files for a CSAF document, they SHOULD be copied as well.
  If the issuing party does not provide those files, they SHALL be created by the CSAF aggregator.
  Such a signature does not imply any liability of CSAF aggregator for the content of the corresponding CSAF document.
  It just confirms that the CSAF document provided has not been modified after being downloaded from the issuing party.
  A CSAF aggregator MAY add additional signatures and hashes for a CSAF document.

Additionally, a CSAF aggregator MAY list one or more issuing parties that it does not mirror.

> The purpose of this role is to provide a single point where CSAF documents can be retrieved.
> Multiple CSAF aggregators are expected to exist around the world. None of them is required to mirror all CSAF documents of all issuing parties.
> CSAF aggregators can be provided for free or as a paid service.
>
> To aid in automation, CSAF aggregators MAY mirror CSAF documents from CSAF publishers.
> Regarding the terms of use they SHOULD consult with the issuing party.
> The purpose of this option is that a consumer can retrieve CSAF documents from a CSAF publisher as if this issuing party would be a
> CSAF trusted provider. To reach that goal, a CSAF aggregator collects the CSAF documents from the CSAF publisher and mirrors it.
> The collection process MAY be automated or manual. CSAF aggregators announce the collection interval through the field `update_interval` in
> the corresponding item of the CSAF publishers list (`csaf_publishers`) in their `aggregator.json`.
> To minimize the implementation efforts and process overhead, a CSAF aggregator MAY upload the CSAF documents of a CSAF publisher into
> an internal instance of a CSAF provider software.
> Such construct is called "CSAF proxy provider" as it can be mirrored by the CSAF aggregator software.
> However, such a CSAF proxy provider MUST NOT be accessible from anyone else than the CSAF aggregator itself.
> Otherwise, that would violate the second rule of section [7.2.1](#role-csaf-publisher).
> Therefore, it is recommended to expose the CSAF proxy provider only on localhost and allow the access only from the CSAF aggregator software.

## 7.3 Retrieving rules <a id='retrieving-rules'></a>

The retrieving process executes in two phases: Finding the `provider-metadata.json` (requirement 7 in section [7.1](#requirements)) and
retrieving CSAF documents.

> A retrieving party SHOULD do the first phase every time.
> Based on the setup and use case of the retrieving party it MAY choose to do it less often,
> e.g. only when adding new or updating distributing parties.
> In that case, it SHOULD to check regularly whether new information is available.

### 7.3.1 Finding provider-metadata.json <a id='finding-provider-metadata-json'></a>

**Direct locating**: The following process SHOULD be used to determine the location of a `provider-metadata.json`
(requirement 7 in section [7.1](#requirements)) based on the main domain of the issuing party:

1. Checking the Well-known URL (requirement 9 in section [7.1](#requirements))
2. Checking the security.txt (requirement 8 in section [7.1](#requirements))
3. Checking the DNS path (requirement 10 in section [7.1](#requirements))
4. Select one or more `provider-metadata.json` to use.

> The term "checking" used in the listing above SHOULD be understood as follows:
> Try to access the resource and test whether the response provides an expected result as defined in the requirement in section 7.1.
> If that is the case, the step was successful - otherwise not.

The first two steps SHOULD be performed in all cases as the security.txt MAY advertise additional `provider-metadata.json`.
The third step SHOULD only be performed if the first two did not result in the location of at least one `provider-metadata.json`.

**Indirect locating**: A retrieving party MAY choose to determine the location of a `provider-metadata.json` by retrieving
its location from an `aggregator.json` (requirement 21 in section [7.1](#requirements)) of a CSAF lister or CSAF aggregator.

### 7.3.2 Retrieving CSAF documents <a id='retrieving-csaf-documents'></a>

Given a `provider-metadata.json`, the following process SHOULD be used to retrieve CSAF documents:

1. Parse the `provider-metadata.json` to determine whether the directory-based (requirements 11 to 14 in section [7.1](#requirements))
   or ROLIE-based distribution (requirements 15 to 17 in section [7.1](#requirements)) is used.
   If both are present, the ROLIE information SHOULD be preferred.
2. For any CSAF trusted provider, the hash and signature files (requirements 18 to 19 in section [7.1](#requirements)) SHOULD be retrieved together
   with the CSAF document.
   They MUST be checked before further processing the CSAF document.
3. Test the CSAF document against the schema.
4. Execute mandatory tests on the CSAF document.

-------

# 8. Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations <a id='safety-security-and-data-protection-considerations'></a>

CSAF documents are based on JSON, thus the security considerations of \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259)\] apply and are repeated here as service for the reader:
> Generally, there are security issues with scripting languages.  JSON is a subset of JavaScript but excludes assignment and invocation.
>
> Since JSON's syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to use that language's `eval()` function to parse most JSON texts
> (but not all; certain characters such as `U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR` and `U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR` are legal in JSON but not JavaScript).
> This generally constitutes an unacceptable security risk, since the text could contain executable code along with data declarations.
> The same consideration applies to the use of eval()-like functions in any other programming language in which JSON texts conform to
> that language's syntax.

In addition, CSAF documents may be rendered by consumers in various human-readable formats like HTML or PDF.
Thus, for security reasons, CSAF producers and consumers SHALL adhere to the following:

* CSAF producers SHOULD NOT emit messages that contain HTML, even though GitHub-flavoured Markdown is permitted.
  To include HTML, source code, or any other content that may be interpreted or executed by a CSAF consumer,
  e.g. to provide a proof-of-concept, the issuing party SHALL use Markdown's fenced code blocks or inline code option.
* Deeply nested markup can cause a stack overflow in the Markdown processor \[[GFMENG](#GFMENG)\].
  To reduce this risk, CSAF consumers SHALL use a Markdown processor that is hardened against such attacks.
  **Note**: One example is the GitHub fork of the `cmark` Markdown processor \[[GFMCMARK](#GFMCMARK)\].
* To reduce the risk posed by possibly malicious CSAF files that do contain arbitrary HTML (including, for example, `data:image/svg+xml`),
  CSAF consumers SHALL either disable HTML processing (for example, by using the `--safe` option in the `cmark` Markdown processor)
  or run the resulting HTML through an HTML sanitizer.
* To reduce the risk posed by possibly malicious links within a CSAF document (including, for example, `javascript:` links),
  CSAF consumers SHALL either remove all actions from links (for example, by displaying them as standard text)
or render only those actionable that are known to be safe (for example, determining that via the media type).
CSAF consumers that are not prepared to deal with the security implications of formatted messages SHALL NOT attempt to
render them and SHALL instead fall back to the corresponding plain text messages. As also any other programming code can
be contained within a CSAF document, CSAF consumers SHALL ensure that none of the values of a CSAF document is run as code.
Moreover, it SHALL be treated as unsafe (user) input.
  > Additional, supporting mitigation measures like retrieving only CSAF documents from trusted sources and check their integrity and
  > signature before parsing the document SHOULD be in place to reduce the risk further.

# 9. Conformance <a id='conformance'></a>

In the only subsection of this section, the conformance targets and clauses are listed.
The clauses, matching the targets one to one, are listed in separate sub-subsections of the targets listing subsection.

Informative Comments:

> The order in which targets, and their corresponding clauses appear is somewhat arbitrary as there is
> no natural order on such diverse roles participating in the document exchanging ecosystem.
>
> Except for the target **CSAF document**, all other 16 targets span a taxonomy of the complex CSAF ecosystems existing
> in and between diverse security advisory generating, sharing, and consuming communities.
>
> In any case, there are no capabilities organized in increasing quality levels for targets because
> the security advisory sharing communities follow the chain link model.
> Instead, a single minimum capability level for every target is given to maintain important goals of providing
> a common framework for security advisories:
>
> * Fast production, sharing, and actionable consumption of security advisories
> * Consistent end to end automation through collaborating actors
> * Clear baseline across the communities per this specification
> * Additional per-community cooperative extensions which may flow back into future updates of this specification

### 9.1.1 Conformance Clause 1: CSAF document <a id='conformance-clause-1-csaf-document'></a>

A text file or data stream satisfies the "CSAF document" conformance profile if it:

* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [2.2](#date-and-time)
* conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section [3](#schema-elements).
* satisfies at least one profile defined in section [4](#profiles).
* does not fail any mandatory test defined in section [6.1](#mandatory-tests).

### 9.1.2 Conformance Clause 2: CSAF producer <a id='conformance-clause-2-csaf-producer'></a>

A program satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile if the program:

* produces output in the CSAF format, according to the conformance profile "CSAF document".
* satisfies those normative requirements in section [3](#schema-elements) and [8](#safety-security-and-data-protection-considerations) that
  are designated as applying to CSAF producers.

### 9.1.3 Conformance Clause 3: CSAF direct producer <a id='conformance-clause-3-csaf-direct-producer'></a>

An analysis tool satisfies the "CSAF direct producer" conformance profile if the analysis tool:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [3](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to "direct producers" or
  to "analysis tools".
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [3](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by converters.

### 9.1.4 Conformance Clause 4: CSAF converter <a id='conformance-clause-4-csaf-converter'></a>

A converter satisfies the âCSAF converterâ conformance profile if the converter:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section [3](#schema-elements) that are designated as applying to converters.
* does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section [3](#schema-elements),
  are intended to be produced only by direct producers.

### 9.1.5 Conformance Clause 5: CVRF CSAF converter <a id='conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter'></a>

A program satisfies the "CVRF CSAF converter" conformance profile if the program fulfills the following two groups of requirements:

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CVRF documents as input.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* type `/$defs/branches_t`: If any `prod:Branch` instance has the type `Realm` or `Resource`,
  the CVRF CSAF converter replaces those with the category `product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that those types do not exist in CSAF and have been replaced with the category `product_name`.
* type `/$defs/version_t`: If any element doesn't match the semantic versioning,
  replace the all elements of type `/$defs/version_t` with the corresponding integer version.
  For that, CVRF CSAF converter sorts the items of `/document/tracking/revision_history` by `number` ascending according to the rules of CVRF.
  Then, it replaces the value of `number` with the index number in the array (starting with 1).
  The value of `/document/tracking/version` is replaced by value of `number` of the corresponding revision item.
  The match MUST be calculated by the original values used in the CVRF document.
  If this conversion was applied, for each Revision the original value of `cvrf:Number` MUST be set as `legacy_version` in the converted document.
* `/document/acknowledgments[]/organization` and `/vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments[]/organization`:
  If more than one `cvrf:Organization` instance is given, the CVRF CSAF converter converts the first one into the `organization`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of document or vulnerability acknowledgment.
* `/document/lang`: If one or more CVRF element containing an `xml:lang` attribute exist and contain the exact same value,
  the CVRF CSAF converter converts this value into `lang`.
  If the values of `xml:lang` attributes are not equal, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that the language could not be
  determined and possibly a document with multiple languages was produced.
  In addition, it SHOULD also present all values of `xml:lang` attributes as a set in the warning.
* `/document/publisher/name` and `/document/publisher/namespace`:
  Sets the value as given in the configuration of the program or the corresponding argument the program was invoked with.
  If values from both sources are present, the program SHOULD prefer the latter one.
  The program SHALL NOT use hard-coded values.
* `/document/tracking/id`: If the element `cvrf:ID` contains any line breaks or leading or trailing white space,
  the CVRF CSAF converter removes those characters.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that the ID was changed.
* `/product_tree/relationships[]`: If more than one `prod:FullProductName` instance is given,
  the CVRF CSAF converter converts the first one into the `full_product_name`.
  In addition, the converter outputs a warning that information might be lost during conversion of product relationships.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`:
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
    using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of
    `/document/tracking/current_release_date` of the source document.
    If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
    of the source document SHOULD be used.
    > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

    If the CWE does not match at all, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST omit this CWE and output a warning that an invalid CWE was found and has
    been removed.
  * If a `vuln:CWE` instance refers to a CWE category or view, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST omit this instance and output a
    warning that this CWE has been removed as its usage is not allowed in vulnerability mappings.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/ids`: If a `vuln:ID` element is given, the CVRF CSAF converter converts it into the first item of the `ids` array.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * If neither `product_ids` nor `group_ids` are given, the CVRF CSAF converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under
    `../product_status` in the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected` into `product_ids`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this remediation element.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `Vendor Fix` into the category `optional_patch` if the product in
    question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST be set.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to
    different product status groups, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance
    to `optional_patch` and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST convert any remediation with the type `None Available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the future or no `Date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the type `None Available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the type `Vendor Fix` with a `Date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CVRF CSAF converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/metrics[]`:
  * For any CVSS v4 element, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard. (CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v4.0.)
  * For any CVSS v3 element, the CVRF CSAF converter MUST compute the `baseSeverity` from the `baseScore` according to
    the rules of the applicable CVSS standard.
  * If no `product_id` is given, the CVRF CSAF converter appends all Product IDs which are listed under `../product_status` in
    the arrays `known_affected`, `first_affected` and `last_affected`.
    If none of these arrays exist, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that no matching Product ID was found for this score element.
  * If a `vectorString` is missing, the CVRF CSAF converter outputs an error that the CVSS element could not be converted as
    the CVSS vector was missing.
    A CVRF CSAF converter MAY offer a configuration option to delete such elements.
  * If there are CVSS v3.0 and CVSS v3.1 Vectors available for the same product, the CVRF CSAF converter discards
    the CVSS v3.0 information and provide in CSAF only the CVSS v3.1 information.
  * To determine, which minor version of CVSS v3 is used and to evaluate a CVSS v4 that was wrongly inserted in a CVSS v3 element,
    the CVRF CSAF converter uses the following steps:
    1. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS vector, if present.

        *Example 1:*<a id='conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter-eg-1'></a><a id='sec-9-1-5-eg-1'></a><a id='example-163'></a>

        ```
          CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H => 3.1
        ```

    2. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS element's namespace, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the element's namespace.

        *Example 2:*<a id='conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter-eg-2'></a><a id='sec-9-1-5-eg-2'></a><a id='example-164'></a>

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv31="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd"
          <!-- -->
          <cvssv31:ScoreSetV3>
        ```

        is handled the same as

        *Example 3:*<a id='conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter-eg-3'></a><a id='sec-9-1-5-eg-3'></a><a id='example-165'></a>

        ```
          <ScoreSetV3 xmlns="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.xsd">
        ```

    3. Retrieve the CVSS version from the CVSS namespace given in the root element, if present.
       The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was guessed from the global namespace.
       If more than one CVSS namespace is present and the element is not clearly defined via the namespace,
       this step MUST be skipped without a decision.

        *Example 4:*<a id='conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter-eg-4'></a><a id='sec-9-1-5-eg-4'></a><a id='example-166'></a>

        ```
          xmlns:cvssv3="https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.xsd" => 3.0
        ```

    4. Retrieve the CVSS version from a config value, which defaults to `3.0`.
       (As CSAF CVRF v1.2 predates CVSS v3.1.) The CVRF CSAF converter outputs a warning that this value was taken from the config.

### 9.1.6 Conformance Clause 6: CSAF content management system <a id='conformance-clause-6-csaf-content-management-system'></a>

A CSAF content management system satisfies the "CSAF content management system" conformance profile if the content management system:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* satisfies the "CSAF viewer" conformance profile.
* provides at least the following management functions:

  * create new CSAF documents
  * prefill CSAF documents based on values given in the configuration (see below)
  * create a new version of an existing CSAF document
  * checkout old versions of a CSAF document
  * show all differences between versions of a CSAF document
  * list all CSAF documents within the system
  * delete CSAF documents from the system
  * review CSAF documents in the system
  * approve CSAF documents
  * search for CSAF documents by values of required fields at `document`-level or their children within the system
  * search for CSAF documents by values of `cve` within the system
  * search for CSAF documents based on properties of `product_tree`
  * filter on all properties which it is required to search for
  * export of CSAF documents
  * show an audit log for each CSAF document
  * identify the latest version of CSAF documents with the same `/document/tracking/id`
  * suggest a `/document/tracking/id` based on the given configuration.
  * track of the version of CSAF documents automatically and increment according to the versioning scheme
    (see also subsections of [3.1.11](#version-type)) selected in the configuration.
  * check that the document version is set correctly based on the changes in comparison to the previous version
    (see also subsections of [3.1.11](#version-type)).
  * suggest to use the document status `interim` if a CSAF document is updated more frequent than the given threshold in
    the configuration (default: 3 weeks)
  * suggest to publish a new version of the CSAF document with the document status `final` if the document status was
    `interim` and no new release has be done during the given threshold in the configuration (default: 6 weeks)
  * support the following workflows:

    * "New Advisory": create a new advisory, request a review, provide review comments or approve it, resolve review comments;
      if the review approved it, the approval for publication can be requested;
      if granted the document status changes to `final` (or `Ã¬nterim` based on the selection in approval or configuration)
      and the advisory is provided for publication (manual or time-based)
    * "Update Advisory": open an existing advisory, create new revision & change content, request a review,
      provide review comments or approve it, resolve review comments;
      if the review approved it, the approval for publication can be requested;
      if granted the document status changes to `final` (or `Ã¬nterim` based on the selection in approval or configuration)
      and the advisory is provided for publication (manual or time-based)

* offers both: publication immediately or at a given date/time.
* automates handling of date/time and version.
* provides an API to retrieve all CSAF documents which are currently in the status published.
* optionally provides an API to import or create new advisories from outside systems (e.g. bug tracker, CVD platform,...).
* provides a user management and support at least the following roles:

  * _Registered_: Able to see all published CSAF documents (but only in the published version).
  * _Author_: inherits _Registered_ permissions and also can Create and Edit Own (mostly used for automated creation, see above)
  * _Editor_: inherits _Author_ permissions and can Edit (mostly used in PSIRT)
  * _Publisher_: inherits _Editor_ permissions and can Change state and Review any (mostly used as HEAD of PSIRT or team lead)
  * _Reviewer_: inherits _Registered_ permissions and can Review advisories assigned to him (might be a subject matter expert or management)
  * _Manager_: inherits _Publisher_ permissions and can Delete; User management up to _Publisher_
  * _Administrator_: inherits _Manager_ permissions and can Change the configuration

* may use groups to support client separation (multitenancy) and therefore restrict the roles to actions within their group.
  In this case, there MUST be a _Group configurator_ which is able to change the values which are used to prefill fields in
  new advisories for that group. He might also do the user management for the group up to a configured level.
* prefills the following fields in new CSAF documents with the values given below or based on the templates from configuration:

  * `/$schema` with the value prescribed by the schema
  * `/document/csaf_version` with the value prescribed by the schema
  * `/document/language`
  * `/document/notes`
    * `legal_disclaimer` (Terms of use from the configuration)
    * `general` (General Security recommendations from the configuration)
  * `/document/tracking/current_release_date` with the current date
  * `/document/tracking/generator` and children
  * `/document/tracking/initial_release_date` with the current date
  * `/document/tracking/revision_history`

### 9.1.18 Conformance Clause 18: CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter <a id='conformance-clause-18-csaf-2-0-to-csaf-2-1-converter'></a>

A program satisfies the "CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter" conformance profile if the program fulfills the following two groups of requirements:

Firstly, the program:

* satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* takes only CSAF 2.0 documents as input.
* additionally satisfies the normative requirements given below.

Secondly, the program fulfills the following for all items of:

* type `/$defs/full_product_name_t/cpe`: If a CPE is invalid, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD removed the invalid value and output a
  warning that an invalid CPE was detected and removed. Such a warning MUST include the invalid CPE.
* `/$schema`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST set property with the value prescribed by the schema.
* `/document/csaf_version`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST update the value to `2.1`.
* `/document/distribution/tlp/label`: If a TLP label is given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert it according to the table below:
  
  | CSAF 2.0 (using TLP v1.0) | CSAF 2.1 (using TLP v2.0) |
  |---------------------------|---------------------------|
  | `TLP:WHITE`               | `TLP:CLEAR`               |
  | `TLP:GREEN`               | `TLP:GREEN`               |
  | `TLP:AMBER`               | `TLP:AMBER`               |
  | `TLP:RED`                 | `TLP:RED`                 |

  If `/document/distribution/text` contains the string `TLP v2.0: TLP:<ValidTLPLabel>`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD provide an
  option to use this label instead. If the TLP label changes through such conversion in a way that is not reflected in the table above, the
  the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST output a warning that the TLP label was taken from the distribution text. Such a warning MUST include
  both values: the converted one based on the table and the one from the distribution text.
  > This is a common case for CSAF 2.0 documents labeled as `TLP:RED` but actually intended to be `TLP:AMBER+STRICT`.

  If no TLP label was given, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD assign `TLP:CLEAR` and output a warning that the default TLP has been set.
* `/document/publisher/category`: If the value is `other`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter SHOULD output a warning that some parties have
  been regrouped into the new value `multiplier`. An option to suppress this warning MUST exist. In addition, an option SHOULD be provided to
  set the value to `multiplier`.
* `/document/title`: If the value contains the `/document/tracking/id`, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST remove the `/document/tracking/id`
  from the `/document/title`. In addition, separating characters including but not limited to whitespace, colon, dash and brackets MUST be removed.
* `/vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]`: The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST determine the CWE specification version the given CWE was selected from by
  using the latest version that matches the `id` and `name` exactly and was published prior to the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
  of the source document. If no such version exist, the first matching version published after the value of `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
  of the source document SHOULD be used.
  > This is done to create a deterministic conversion.

  The tool SHOULD implement an option to use the latest available CWE version at the time of the conversion that still matches.

* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]`:
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `vendor_fix` into the category `optional_patch`
    if the product in question is in one of the product status groups "Not Affected" or "Fixed" for this vulnerability.
    Otherwise, the category `vendor_fix` MUST stay the same.
    If multiple products are associated with the remediation - either directly or through a product group - and the products belong to different
    product status groups, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST duplicate the remediation, change the category in one instance to `optional_patch`
    and distribute the products accordingly as stated by the conversion rule.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST convert any remediation with the category `none_available` into the category `fix_planned`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the future or no `date` at all.
    Consequently, the product MUST be removed from the remediation of the category `vendor_fix`.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST remove any product from a remediation with the category `none_available`
    if the product in question is also listed in a remediation of the category `vendor_fix` with a `date` in the past or to the exact same time.
    If it was the last product in that remediation, the remediation MUST be removed.
  * In any other case, the CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST preserve the product in the remediation of the category `none_available`.
  * The CSAF 2.0 to CSAF 2.1 converter MUST output a warning if a remediation was added, deleted or the value of the category was changed,
    including the products it was changed for.

> A tool MAY implement options to convert other Markdown formats to GitHub-flavored Markdown.

> A tool MAY implement an additional, non-default option to output an invalid document that can be fixed afterwards. Solely in this case, any
> of the rules above MAY be ignored to avoid data loss.

# Appendix C. Guidance on the Size of CSAF Documents <a id='guidance-on-the-size-of-csaf-documents'></a>

This appendix provides informative guidance on the size of CSAF documents.

The TC carefully considered all known aspects to provide size limits for CSAF documents for this version of the specification with
the result that hard limits SHOULD NOT be enforced.
However, since there is the need for guidance to ensure interoperability in the ecosystem, the TC provides a set of soft limits.
A CSAF document which exceeds those, can still be valid but it might not be processable for some parties.

All _CSAF consumers_ SHOULD be able to process CSAF documents which comply with the limits below.
All _CSAF producers_ SHOULD NOT produce CSAF documents which exceed those limits.

> If you come across a case where these limits are exceeded, please provide feedback to the TC.

## Appendix C. File Size <a id='file-size'></a>

A CSAF document in the specified JSON format encoded in UTF-8 SHOULD conform to known size limits of current technologies parsing JSON content,
e.g.: 50 MiB.

> The CSAF documents observed in the wild expose strongly varying sizes as per the use cases they serve.
> At least one database technology in wide use for storing CSAF documents rejects insert attempts when
> the transformed BSON size exceeds 16 megabytes.
> The BSON format optimizes for accessibility and not size.
> So, small integers and small strings may incur more overhead in the BSON format than in JSON.
> In addition, the BSON format adds length information for the entries inside the document,
> which adds to the size when storing CSAF document content in a BSON format.

## Appendix C. Array Length <a id='array-length'></a>

An array SHOULD NOT have more than:

* 10 000 items for
  * `/document/acknowledgments`

## C.6 Date <a id='date'></a>

The maximum length of strings representing a temporal value is given by the format specifier. This applies to:

* `/document/tracking/current_release_date`
* `/document/tracking/generator/date`
* `/document/tracking/initial_release_date`
* `/document/tracking/revision_history[]/date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/discovery_date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/flags[]/date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/release_date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/involvements[]/date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations[]/date`
* `/vulnerabilities[]/threats[]/date`

## C.5 Enum <a id='enum'></a>

A string which is an enum has a fixed maximum length given by its longest value.

> Later versions of CSAF might add, modify or delete possible value which could change the longest value.
> Therefore, this sizes should not be implemented as fixed limits if forward compatibility is desired.

The value of `/$schema` is a fixed URL, currently pointing to the JSON schema location.
It seems to be safe to assume that the length of this value is not greater than 150. This applies to:

* `/$schema` (64)

For all other values, it seems to be safe to assume that the length of each value is not greater than 50.
