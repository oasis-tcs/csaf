## Meeting Notes

- Congratulations! 
- Specifications approved and working on a press release. With folks in holiday, this may not materialize until several weeks.  
- Call to action CSAF 2.0 now public and will share it on social media and blog post.
- Can put your company name or organization on OASIS website (for those listed) and Website and ours.
- For first 100 adopters will set a date and then stop updating list when it becomes a big deal.   
- CS02 issues on initial sections of documents. Some spelling issues that came in late. Maybe we can correct that and can correct stuff in the beginning.  Another version or proceed to next CS02?  
- CS02 has a short public view. We will ask for advice.  We did spot it in the public review but nothing too bad.  
- Thomas was accepted as speaker for RSA and would be happy to see you all there.  
- Distributing CSAF docs, to show up in GitHub : https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution
