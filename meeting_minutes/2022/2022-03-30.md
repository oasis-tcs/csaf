## Meeting Notes

- CSAF Version 2.0 Working Draft as Committee Specification 02
  - The motion to approve CSAF Version 2.0 Working Draft as Committee Specification Draft 02 passed; however, when we submitted the information to OASIS and after further research, it was found that the changes were material (i.e., the CSAF aggregator and CSAF full validator (optional test) and some non-material changes (invalid timestamps, missing SBOM URI guidance), we decided to create a new editor revision.
