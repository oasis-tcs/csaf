## Meeting Notes

- Next Steps for CSAF as OASIS Standard: 
  - Now that CSAF is a Committee Spec, the next step is to get your 3 or more Statements of Use.
  - At least one has to come from an OASIS member and must be approved by the Primary Rep.
  - Then request the Special Majority Vote to approve by submitting it to the OASIS membership for consent.


- Within the next month Cisco will create CSAF.  
- Any other companies here supporting CSAF?  
  - Will Rideout, from Arista Networks will be sending a request to security engineering team and then will be ready for statement of use.  
- Can use statement of use as a consumer? Yes, chicken and egg or in same boat.  
  - Thomas P, from Siemens AG is not sure what to put there.  Who needs to sign it?
- Minimum CSAF TC original email and Chet from OASIS is helping through the process of collecting data. 
- Re: CSAF data, will be using and will put it in website for the public so they can see the support behind it.
  - Denny, from TIBCO Software Inc.  – working on implementation and there is a lot to do – probably 2 months out.  
  - CSAF internally will be used in production.  
  - MITRE submission will be derived from CSAF.  
  - Not quite in position to say we are publishing yet. 
- Even if it doesn’t get done in 6 months down the road from now, don’t feel bad.  
  - Thomas S, from BSI can put statement of use of standard.  
  - Will complete in 2 months.  
  - CSAF provider, aggregator and lister will be finished by the end of February or March. 
- We can decide now – should we move to next step of OASIS standard of 2.0.
- https://github.com/CSAF-poc/CSAF_distribution
- Thomas S - during implementation found a couple of issues.  
  - Will get one committee draft and go to OASIS afterwards.
  - Stefan may know more about time of delaying OASIS standard. 
  - Or directly now, then start on CSAF 2.1?  
- Stefan –
- Waiting for CS to complete. 
- Statement of use can take 2 or more months.  
- Will take time and effort for a more promising result.  
- Like the idea of putting in 2.0 and wait for critical mass for 2.1. 
- Can split resources between 2.0 and 2.1, but as a standards business this may be risky, and we can split our audience.  
- Even though we are planning on working CSAF in companies, it is more difficult to get them.  
- By enhancing what we have now if there are bugs, issues, Thomas should consider that. 
  - No comments or concerns from team.  
  - Thomas S proposed motion:
- To work in CSAF now with issues and then submit to CSAF 2.0 and continue to get statement of use, by representatives here or by industry to make OASIS standard. 
- Thomas P accepted the motion.
- Stefan second.
- Motion approved.
  - Thomas S –
- Is working with an editor to complete issues within editor revision and expects it to be ready for the next meeting.  
- March is the worse-case goal for having that work complete.
  - Stefan – 
- Replied in a mailer list, that a discussion is needed to triage if we try to put it in the new standard or raise concerns outside of TC.  
- Not as mechanical as adding something.    
  - Feng, from oracle will be using CSAF and would like to know if other vendors are doing this before April and would like to coordinate.  
  - Martin, from RedHat distributed CSAF and hopes to publish in March time frame.  

- From a tooling perspective Stefan is working on CSAF validator. BSI is working on many tools (details below). 
- Creating tests for CSAF documents.  
- Any questions reach out to Thomas S and can store and manage CSAF workflow open-source implementation. 
  - Omar – 
- Will do work as individual company contributors.  
- It will be ok to put logos on CSAF website by late February.
- Thomas S 
- Will have to confirm with people in company.  
- It should be industry driven and should be able to have as many companies supporting CSAF and then can ask folks in the office to put logo there.  
- Wait until we have 3 Statement of uses, Omar, confirm 5 here or maybe more than 5.  Wait and then populate logo.  
  - Thomas P will have to ask his team too.  
  - Thomas S – 
- Will do our S4 presentations on CSAF.  
- RSA scheduled in June and S4 in April and will be aiming for April.  
- Maybe defer until next meeting.  
- We all can check with our offices about putting up logos.
  - Team agrees. 
  - Will – 
- Stefan is working on a validation test using Python and working in Arista – if anyone doesn’t want to duplicate work can work faster on that.  
- Thomas will work on a review and needs to look at source code.  
- Can come in with planning around tools.  
- Is TC interested in this?  
  - Yes
  - Thomas S –
- Will write, in August or September, a guide so it is easier for people to adopt CSAF.  
- Also, Wizard is easier to use and can ask questions – to ask about advisories, based on the profiles that we have.  
- Also have a CVRF converter – looking for CSAF basic validators if Stefan has open source would appreciate it so don’t have to implement. 
- Working on a project to implement for ourselves and is in early stages - won’t be live before 2023.  

## BSI's contribution on tools (all MIT License):
- [Secvisogram](https://github.com/secvisogram/secvisogram) as a [Javascrpit-based online editor](https://secvisogram.github.io) to create and edit CSAF documents. It currently (version 1.11.0) implements all mandatory tests from CS01. Ready to use.
- [CSAF trusted provider](https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution) is a Go implementation of the [CSAF trusted provider role from section 7.2.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs01/csaf-v2.0-cs01.html#723-role-csaf-trusted-provider).

  - [CSAF uploader](https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution/tree/main/cmd/csaf_uploader): more or less `curl` with a more usable command line interface
  - [Provider checker](https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution/tree/main/cmd/csaf_checker): checks for a given domain whether it supports one of the CSAF distribution methods
- [CSAF Aggregator](https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution/tree/aggregator/cmd/csaf_aggregator) is a Go implementation of the [CSAF lister role from section 7.2.4](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs01/csaf-v2.0-cs01.html#724-role-csaf-lister) and [CSAF aggregator from section 7.2.5](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs01/csaf-v2.0-cs01.html#725-role-csaf-aggregator). It is WORK IN PROGRESS in early stages - assumed to be ready mid-March 2022.
- [CVRF CSAF converter](https://github.com/csaf-tools/CVRF-CSAF-Converter): is a Python3 implementation of the [CVRF CSAF converter from section 9.1.5](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs01/csaf-v2.0-cs01.html#915-conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter). It is WORK IN PROGRESS - assumed to be ready end of February / mid-March 2022.
