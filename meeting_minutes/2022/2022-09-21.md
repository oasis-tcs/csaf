  - We'll reach out shortly to the TC's Sponsor-level members with requests for press release quotes.
  - TC team please provide the “name/email of your organization's marketing contact by next Friday, 30 September, so that we can collaborate on some exciting promotional opportunities surrounding the upcoming CSAF announcement.”
  - “OASIS is in the process of drafting a press release in anticipation of CSAF v2.0 being approved as an OASIS Standard. We're targeting the distribution date of either 14 or 15 November.”

- Jane's update:
  - Since there is time before the release is going out, please plan out some sort of webinar within two weeks of that release.
  - Should highlight changes or whatever we want to highlight.  
  - TC volunteers wanted for that as well and press release – a blog would be a good idea.  
  - Marketing contacts that we prefer we work with, press release, blogs, etc., open to all suggestions. 
  - Would like at least one blog post about it on website.  
  - Emails will be sent out after public review is done, around the last week of October.
