- Omar moved to allow the CSAF TC Editors to perform any non-material changes such as spelling errors and capitalization of words in GitHub without the need to vote for any of those changes in a meeting.
  - Denny seconded.
  - The motion passed with no objections.
- Thomas Schmidt moves that the TC approves CSAF Version 2.0 Working Draft and all associated artifacts uniquely identified by the below listed hashes and packed together in a zip file as Committee Specification 03 and designate the markdown version of the specification as authoritative and direct the Chair supported by the Editors to perform any tasks and non-material changes as required by TC Admin to facilitate that issuance. I further move that the TC requests a Special Majority Vote to approve them as Committee Specification 03 with non-material changes and direct the Chair perform any tasks as required by TC Admin to facilitate that issuance.

The referenced hashes for the 4 artifacts we submit to TC Admins are:
