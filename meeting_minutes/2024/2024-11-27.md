### GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

- Issue [#832](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/832)
  - Discussed need for generic examples rather than specific company names to avoid omitting other companies
  - TC agreed to work on wording and provide links to examples in GitHub repository
  - [An email was sent to the TC](https://groups.oasis-open.org/discussion/call-to-action-for-832) as a call to action to provide additional examples.

- Issue [#817](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/817)
  - Discussed need for clear separation between hardware and software in product identification helpers
  - Motion passed to add section addressing this separation
  - Motion set by Thomas Schmidt and seconded by Stefan.

- Issue [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812)
  - Feng provided the update of the CVE efforts around CPE assignments and the reference to: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/feed/1.1/nvd_cve_feed_json_1.1.schema
  - Thomas Schmidt moves to adopt the implementation of a mandatory test within the CSAF validation process to identify and flag discrepancies between the product_identification_helper and the product details specified in the branches section of CSAF documents. This test will focus on low-hanging issues, such as missing version numbers in Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifiers or Package URLs (purls).
  - The motion was seconded by Sonny. The motion passed.

- Issue [#790](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/790)
  - Stefan moves to adopt the changes presented this issue.
  - The motion was seconded by Denny. The motion passed. 

- Issue [#782](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/782)
  - There was a discussion about this issue (to Differentiate Between `disclosure_date` and `first_known_exploitation_date` in CSAF Documents)
  - A few folks suggested not to include these fields. However, for the purpose of documentation and awareness. The suggestion is not to include these as mandatory fields, but OPTIONAL fields.
  - Feng and Sonny presented some concerns about including this from a vendor standpoint.
  - Omar suggested that it will be good to introduce a differentiation in the `/vulnerabilities[]` section of CSAF documents by defining two distinct fields: `disclosure_date` and `first_known_exploitation_date`.
  - An OPTIONAL field, that clarifies the distinction between when a vulnerability is disclosed and when it is observed to be actively exploited.  
  - Omar[ sent an email to the broader TC](https://groups.oasis-open.org/discussion/issue-782-differentiate-betweendisclosure-dateandfirst-known-exploitation-datein-csaf-documents) to discuss this issue.
