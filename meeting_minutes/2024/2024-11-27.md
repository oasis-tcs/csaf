- No nominations received for secretary position
- Omar sets the motion for the TC to allow the chair to start the nomination and ballot process with the OASIS staff. Stefan seconds the motion. The motion passed without objections or further discussions.

### GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

- Issue [#832](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/832)
  - Discussed need for generic examples rather than specific company names to avoid omitting other companies
  - TC agreed to work on wording and provide links to examples in GitHub repository
  - [An email was sent to the TC](https://groups.oasis-open.org/discussion/call-to-action-for-832) as a call to action to provide additional examples.

- Issue [#817](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/817)
  - Discussed need for clear separation between hardware and software in product identification helpers
  - Motion set by Thomas Schmidt and seconded by Stefan.
  - Motion passed to add section addressing this separation

- Issue [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812)
  - Feng provided the update of the CVE efforts around CPE assignments and the reference to: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/feed/1.1/nvd_cve_feed_json_1.1.schema
  - Thomas Schmidt moves to adopt the implementation of a mandatory test within the CSAF validation process to identify and flag discrepancies between the `product_identification_helper` and the product details specified in the `branches` section of CSAF documents. This test will focus on low-hanging issues, such as missing version numbers in Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifiers or Package URLs (purls).
  - The motion was seconded by Sonny. The motion passed.

- Issue [#790](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/790)
  - Stefan moves to adopt the changes presented this issue.
  - The motion was seconded by Denny. The motion passed. 

- Issue [#782](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/782)
  - There was a discussion about this issue (to differentiate between `disclosure_date` and `first_known_exploitation_date` in CSAF documents)
  - A few folks suggested not to include these fields. However, for the purpose of documentation and awareness it might make sense. The suggestion is not to include these as mandatory fields, but OPTIONAL fields.
  - Feng and Sonny presented some concerns about including this from a vendor standpoint.
  - Omar suggested that it will be good to introduce a differentiation in the `/vulnerabilities[]` section of CSAF documents by defining two distinct fields: `disclosure_date` and `first_known_exploitation_date`.
  - An OPTIONAL field, that clarifies the distinction between when a vulnerability is disclosed and when it is observed to be actively exploited.  
  - Omar[ sent an email to the broader TC](https://groups.oasis-open.org/discussion/issue-782-differentiate-betweendisclosure-dateandfirst-known-exploitation-datein-csaf-documents) to discuss this issue.
