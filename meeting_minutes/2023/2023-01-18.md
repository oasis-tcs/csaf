Note: Observers of this committee that are ready to become Members should follow the specific instructions displayed the OASIS Open Notices tab.

## Agenda
- Discuss the pros and cons of moving CSAF to ISO vs ITU.

## Meeting Notes
- Duncan recommendations for standards is to not go with joint options and select only one. Everyone agreed.
- Duncan suggested that the ITU may be the best option. Duncan has decades of knowledge with ITU.   
- Links shared during the meeting:
  - [ITU standards approval](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/Pages/approval.aspx)
  - [Study Group 17](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/groups/Pages/sg17.aspx)
  - [OASIS TAG to ISO](https://www.oasis-open.org/tags/)
  - [A few examples of ISO approved OASIS standards](https://www.oasis-open.org/2020/08/03/iso-approves-oasis-ebms3-and-as4-as-international-standards-for-messaging/)
- Omar received feedback from other industry-peers outside of OASIS stating that ITU may be the easiest route. 
- Thomas Schmidt:  would like to take the one with the best outcome in quickest time.  
- Starting from scratch from ISO is hard, ITU too but Duncan can help with that process.  
- Stefan is looking for the approach that would make more sense for the TC.   
- ITU standards are free and translations into many languages are too. In case we submit CSAF v2.0 to ISO/IEC it will also be free but will not be translated.
- Stefan mentioned that translations of CSAF may be problematic despite their marketing value.
- ITU translates the standard in multiple languages and that may be good for awareness and adoption.  
- ISO references shared during the meeting:
  - https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html
  - https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html
  - https://www.iso.org/committee/45306.html

## Next Steps
- The TC will decide to go with ITU or ISO during next week's meeting.
- Only one option will be used by OASIS.   
- Create a poll between now and the next TC meeting to get feedback from the TC members.


## Adjourn
The meeting adjourned at 1:54PM US EDT.
