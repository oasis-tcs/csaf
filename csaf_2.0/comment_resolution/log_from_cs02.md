## Evaluation of Feedback

The editors consider above public comments as well as other more editorial feedback documented in issue(s) ... and classified/considered per pull request ... as **Non-Material** per OASIS TC process.

[A motion has been issued during the TC meeting by Thomas Schmidt on 2022-07-20](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/blob/master/meeting_minutes/2022-07-20.md) to promote the resulting revised work products to CS03 including non-material changes only.

To ease verification by anyone and to support the administration a separate [release candidate archive containing the 4 standards track work products has been created](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/releases/tag/cs-03-20220720-rc2) and linked to this issue as well as noted in the motion as annotation in the minutes of meeting.
