*Any submission request delivered to the OASIS President under this policy must be in writing, and must include the following:*

a. *The name(s) of the submission requester(s), that is, the TC, the Member Section, or the OASIS*
   *Organizational Members that support the submission request as described in section 1(d).*

OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) TC

b. *The name of the intended receiving standards organization. The request may also suggest the committee*
   *or group in that organization which should process that submission.*

ISO/IEC\ JTC\ 1 Secretariat (suggesting “SC\ 27 Information security, cybersecurity and privacy
protection” as the published scope at https://www.iso.org/committee/45306.html indicates)

c. *The intended status or outcome that the request seeks from the receiving organization’s process; and a*
   *short description of the receiving organization’s approval process, including estimated time required,*
   *stages of approval and who votes at each stage.*

Intended status: Advance CSAF\ v2.0 OASIS Standard to an ISO/IEC International Standard

Base process: ISO/IEC\ JTC\ 1 PAS Transposition Process involving a Draft International
Standard\ (DIS) ballot followed by a Ballot Resolution Meeting\ (BRM) (if there are comments
during ballots), and potentially a Final DIS\ (FDIS) Ballot.

Modification: Kindly asking OASIS Management to first provide a notice and consultation
period to JTC≤\ 1/SC27, as SC27's support will be helpful before any ballots.

Stages of approval: https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html - Stage 40

                                              *... continued from first page of submission request.*

d. *An explanation of how the submission will benefit OASIS.*

Advancing CSAF\ v2.0 to an international standard draws international attention to the work
done by OASIS and to the organization itself, and governments/regulators may be more
inclined to use the standard because of its ISO/IEC status.

This will help nurture and expand the ongoing liaisons with ISO/IEC JTC 1.

Further, this submission will help maintain OASIS in good standing as a recognized ISO/IEC
JTC\ 1 PAS submitter organization.

Last, but not least, as ISO/IEC standard, the process requirements for the success of the
CSAF\ v2.0 OASIS Standard will be more easily enforceable through certification and audit.

Security advisories still require essential inputs from human experts within organizations and
rely on organizational processes that plausibly implement the preconditions for successful
implementation.

e. *The expected licensing, copyright and other intellectual property terms that will be used by the receiving*
   *organization in regard to the submission.*

ISO/IEC JTC\ 1 will expect that OASIS will abide by the ISO/IEC/ITU-T Common Patent Policy
(indicated by at least notifying ISO/IEC of any patent declarations in the required Explanatory
Report), and will provide ISO/IEC with sufficient copyright license to modify and publish the
resulting ISO/IEC Standard.

The TC offers publication of the standard on the condition that it's not changed otherwise.

As these items have already been agreed with ISO/IEC JTC\ 1 when OASIS was approved as a
PAS Submitter, no new issues are expected.

f. *A statement of the intended future plans for versioning and maintenance of the OASIS Standard and/or*
   *Approved Errata for that standard, and the expected roles of OASIS and the receiving organization. This*
   *must include clear statements of the rules of the receiving organization applicable to maintenance of an*
   *approved submitted standard, and to future versions of that standard; any requirements regarding the*
   *submission of future versions; and a description of how OASIS and the submission requesters expect to*
   *comply with those rules.*

The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee will continue to maintain the CSAF\ v2.0 OASIS
Standards and produce future revisions of them.

For this specific submission (CSAF\ v2.0 OASIS Standard) to ISO/IEC JTC\ 1, OASIS will request to be
named the “JTC\ 1 designated maintenance group” and will follow the required maintenance
procedures (including Systematic Review).

In the course of time, if there are substantive changes to CSAF\ v2.0 (either via the Approved
Errata process or through a new version), OASIS may submit the modified document (or
future version) to ISO/IEC JTC\ 1 at some point in the future.
